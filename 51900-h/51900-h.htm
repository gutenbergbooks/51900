<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>If genius is the capacity for taking infinite pains, Percival
Lowell possessed it abundantly from his study of Esoteric
Shinto, in his earlier life in Japan, to his great calculation
of the position and orbit of an unknown planet beyond
Neptune, at the close of his life. In determining facts he
was thoroughly and rigidly scientific, leaving nothing unexplored
that bore upon the subject; and in his astronomical
investigations it became clear to him that better methods
of doing it were required. At the outset, therefore, he set
up his Observatory in an atmosphere steadier than that
where the older telescopes, and almost all of those then in
existence, did their work; thus seeing much not visible
elsewhere.</p>
<p>But in addition to industry he had an inflammable intellect,
easily ignited by any suggestion or observation, and
when alight glowing in intensity until the work was done.
He had also a highly vivid imagination, compared with
many men of science who proceeded more cautiously; and
hence he sought, not only to ascertain new facts, but to
draw conclusions from them more freely than is customary
with experts of that type. This he felt had often been true
of those who made advances in scientific thought, and he
regarded himself as standing for a time somewhat apart
from most men in his own field. Such an attitude, and
the fact that he had taken up observational astronomy in
middle life, unconnected with any other scientific institution,
tended to make many professional astronomers look
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
upon him askance. So he plowed his own furrow largely
by himself in the spirit of a pioneer, and this little volume
is an attempt to tell what he accomplished.</p>
<p>The writer is very grateful to the Houghton, Mifflin Company,
the Macmillan Company, The Atlantic Monthly, Rhodora,
the Scientific American, and Miss Katharine G. Macartney
(on behalf of Mrs. George Gould) for permission to
quote, sometimes at great length, from books and articles
by and about Percival. The writer desires also to express his
deep obligation to Mr. George R. Agassiz, his brother&rsquo;s intimate
friend and helper, to Dr. Vesto Melvin Slipher, Dr.
Carl O. Lampland and Mr. E. C. Slipher of the Lowell Observatory
at Flagstaff, for reading the manuscript and giving
advice; and to Professor Henry Norris Russell of Princeton
University, for his kindness in not only doing this, but for
writing the two appendices that follow this volume. Without
their help the astronomical part of this book would have
been sadly defective. They have pointed out advances in
knowledge that have made certain of Percival&rsquo;s opinions,
particularly earlier ones, no longer tenable. Some of these he
changed during his lifetime, others he would have changed
had he lived to see the more ample facts since known. Nor
is this a criticism of his work, for astronomy has been
advancing rapidly of late; and when that is true no man
can expect all his views, even if accepted at the time, to
endure. Change in opinions is the penalty of growing
knowledge. It is enough that a man has helped to push
knowledge and thought forward while he lived, and this
Percival, with the exhaustless energy of his nature, certainly
did.</p>

<h1 title="">BIOGRAPHY OF
<br />PERCIVAL LOWELL</h1>
<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br />CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH</h2>
<p>The particular assortment of qualities a man inherits, from
among the miscellaneous lot his ancestors no doubt possessed
and might have transmitted, is of primary importance
to him. In this Percival Lowell was fortunate. From his
father&rsquo;s family he derived a very quick apprehension, a
capacity for intellectual interests, keen and diversified, and
a tireless joy in hard mental labor; while from his mother&rsquo;s
people he drew sociability, ease of companionship and
charm; from both families a scorn of anything mean or
unworthy, a business ability and the physical health that
comes from right living. His life is the story of the use he
made of these heirlooms.</p>
<p>The son of Augustus Lowell and Katharine Bigelow
(Lawrence), Percival Lowell was born in Boston on
March 13, 1855, at 131 Tremont Street where the Shepard
stores now stand. The region was then residential, and his
parents went there so that his mother might be near her
father, the Hon. Abbott Lawrence, whose house was on Park
Street, now the main portion of the Union Club. He had
fallen ill since his return as Minister to England, and was
now failing fast. Percival was her first-born, but others followed
rapidly, involving removal to larger quarters; first to
Park Square, and then to 81 Mount Vernon Street, where
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
even the games of little boys were tinged by the overshadowing
events of the day,&mdash;the drilling and the battles of the
Civil War. He went to a dame school kept by Miss Fette;
and being always a good scholar learned what he should; for
he developed normally. After infancy the summer was
spent at Beverly in the pleasures and occupations of early
childhood.</p>
<p>But in the spring of 1864 there came a sudden change.
His mother was far from well, and losing ground so fast
that his father was advised to take her abroad for a complete
change as her only chance,&mdash;a heroic remedy which
proved in time successful. So the family sailed in the <i>Africa</i>,
a paddle-wheel steamer of 2500 tons with the sails of a full-rigged
ship,&mdash;the father with an invalid wife, four children
aged from nine to two, a nurse sea-sick all the time; and in
addition the care of three more children of a friend in
Europe, with a nurse who was well, but bereft of sense.
However, they arrived safely, spent the summer in England,
and, as all Americans did in those days, went to Paris for
the winter.</p>
<p>Here Percival began a life different from that of his contemporaries
at home; for with his younger brother and his
cousin, George P. Gardner,&mdash;one of the children who had
crossed with him on the <i>Africa</i>&mdash;he went to a French boarding
school kept by a Mr. Kornemann. We were allowed to
come home for Sundays, but spent the rest of the week at
the school,&mdash;a very wise arrangement; for, although there
were some English boys, the atmosphere was French, and
we learned the language easily, by the native method of
teaching it. To Percival this was a great benefit throughout
his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Two winters were spent in this way, the intervening summer
being passed by the family in travel. In the spring of
1866 his parents proposed to go for a few weeks to Italy,
and take the children with them; but Percival was so ill
at ease in travel that he was left at the famous boarding
school kept by the Silligs at Vevey. Although in mature
life a constant traveller, this event was not out of character,
for not being yet old enough to enjoy the results of travel,
or feel the keen interest in them later aroused, he was too
restless to find pleasure in long journeying without an object.
On their return from Italy the family picked him up
and went to Germany, where they were caught by the
seven weeks&rsquo; war with Austria. When it broke out they
were at Schwalbach in Nassau, one of the smaller states
that took sides against Prussia. Percival always remembered
vividly what he there saw, exciting enough for a small boy;
the sudden clatter of a galloping horse, as a man in civilian
dress passed the hotel up a small lane to the left. It was the
burgomaster carrying word of Prussian advance, followed
quickly by the sound of several more horses, and three
videttes in blue galloped past, turning up the main road in
front of the hotel where they supposed the burgomaster had
gone. Up the road they went and disappeared round a turn
to the left at the top of the slope. Scarcely had they vanished
when a squad of green-clad Nassau infantry appeared, and
following half-way up the hill hid behind a wood pile. It
was not long before the Prussian videttes, having failed to
find the burgomaster, came into sight again, leisurely walking
their horses down the road. When abreast of the wood
pile the Nassau squad stole out, firing from the hip in the
manner of the day. Whether they hit anyone we never
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
knew, but the enemy was wholly dispersed, for one of the
horsemen wheeled up the hill, another spurred his horse
down past the hotel, and the third jumped his over the wall
into the garden of the baths. That afternoon a Nassau regiment
marched into the town and bivouacked in the streets,
leaving in the morning to be replaced later in the day by
a Prussian regiment, which in its turn marched off to its
rendezvous near Kissingen.</p>
<p>By the end of the summer of 1866 Mother was well
enough to go home, and the whole family sailed for Boston.
Percival&rsquo;s education there was of the ordinary classical type
preparatory for college, for one year at a school kept by a
Mr. Fette, brother of his teacher in childhood, and then for
five years in that of Mr. George W. C. Noble, whose influence,
both by teaching and character, was strong with
all boys capable of profiting thereby. Percival was always
near the top of his class, especially in the Classics, which he
acquired so easily that while playing with a toy boat, in a
shallow pond made by the melting snow on the lawn at
Brookline, it occurred to him to describe an imaginary shipwreck
thereof; and he did so in some hundreds of Latin
hexameter verses.</p>

<p class="pcap">PERCIVAL LOWELL
<br />And His Biographer</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>In the spring of 1867 Father bought the place at the corner
of Heath and Warren Streets in Brookline, where he lived
until his death in 1900; and where his last child, Amy,
passed her whole life. Here Percival spent his boyhood,
summer and winter, until he went to college, enjoying the
life and sports of the seasons; and, in fact, he was a normal
boy like his comrades, only more so. During the earlier
years Father drove us into town and out again each day,
he going to his office and the children to school. On the
road he talked on all subjects and we learned much in this
way. Somehow he made us feel that every self-respecting
man must work at something that is worth while, and do
it very hard. In our case it need not be remunerative, for
he had enough to provide for that; but it must be of real
significance. I do not know that he ever said this formally,
but, by the tenor of his conversation and his own attitude
toward life, he impressed that conviction deeply upon the
spirit. From his own active and ambitious nature, Percival
little required such a stimulus; and, indeed, he struck out
an intellectual path of his own in boyhood. He took to
astronomy, read many books thereon, had a telescope of
his own, of about two and a quarter inches in diameter,
with which he observed the stars from the flat roof of our
house; and later in life he recalled that with it he had seen
the white snow cap on the pole of Mars crowning a globe
spread with blue-green patches on an orange ground. This
interest he never lost, and after lying half-dormant for many
years it blazed forth again as the dominant one in his life,
and the field of his remarkable achievements.</p>
<p>The two years of school in Paris certainly had not retarded
his progress, if, indeed, the better European discipline
had not advanced it; for he could have been prepared for
college at sixteen, but it was thought well to extend the time
another year and fill in with other things. Strangely enough,
Mr. Noble thought him not so strong as he might be in two
subjects where he later excelled,&mdash;English Composition and
Mathematics,&mdash;and in these he was tutored the year before
entering college. Later he thought he had been misjudged,
but one may suspect it was rather because his interest in
these matters had not been aroused. The capacity was there
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
but not yet awakened. However, he entered college in the
autumn of 1872 not only clear but with honors in Mathematics.
In fact he studied that subject every year in college,
took second-year honors in it, and Professor Benjamin
Peirce, the great mathematician, spoke of him as one of the
most brilliant scholars ever under his observation, hinting to
him that if he would devote himself thereto he could succeed
him in his chair. Yet it was by no means his sole field
of knowledge, for he elected courses also in the Classics,
Physics and History, doing well enough in all of them to
be in the &Phi; &Beta; &Kappa; and have a Commencement part. An
impression of his versatility is given by the fact that in his
senior year he won a Bowdoin Prize for an essay on &ldquo;The
Rank of England as a European Power from the Death of
Elizabeth to the Death of Anne,&rdquo; and spoke his part on
&ldquo;The Nebular Hypothesis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet he was no recluse; for he was constantly that year at
dancing parties in Boston; and, being naturally sociable,
and strongly attached to his friends, he made many in college.
With Harcourt Amory, his Freshman chum, he went
abroad, after graduating in 1876, and spent a year in Europe.
The young men went to London with letters that brought
them into delightful society there, and they travelled over
the British Isles and the Continent. It was mainly the <i>grand
tour</i>; but although he wrote many letters, and kept a journal,
these, so far as preserved, reveal little of his personality
except a keen joy in natural beauty and a readiness in acquaintance
with people casually met. Alone, he went down
the Danube, and tried,&mdash;fortunately without success,&mdash;to
get to the front in the war then raging between Servia and
Turkey. With Harcourt Amory he went also to Palestine
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
and Syria, at that time less visited than they are to-day; but
for this part of his journey, where it would be most interesting,
his journal, if written, is lost. His love of travel had
fairly begun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br />FIRST VISIT TO JAPAN</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1877 he came home; and, having no
impulse toward a profession, he went into the office of his
grandfather, John Amory Lowell, where he was engaged in
helping to manage trust funds. In this,&mdash;in learning the
ways of business, for a time as acting treasurer, that is the
executive head, of a large cotton mill, and withal as a young
man of fashion,&mdash;he spent the next six years. With money
enough for his wants, never extravagant, and with the increase
that came from shrewd investment, he felt free in the
spring of 1883 to go to Japan to study the language and the
people. Both of these he did with his habitual energy, learning
to speak with great rapidity, meeting socially Japanese
and foreign residents in Tokyo, and observing everything to
be seen. His own view of the value of travel and study is
given in a letter to a sister seven years his junior, written
apparently in the preceding summer when she was in Europe.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
&ldquo;I am very glad,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that you are taking so
much interest in studying what you come across in your
journey and after all life itself is but one long journey which
is not only misspent but an unhappy one if one does not
interest one&rsquo;s-self in whatever one encounters&mdash;Besides, from
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
another standpoint, you are storing up for yourself riches
above the reach of fickle fate,&mdash;what the moths and rust
of this world cannot touch. You are making, as it were, a
friend of yourself. One to whom you can go when time or
place shall sever you from others, and the older you grow,
sweet puss, the more you have to depend upon yourself. So,
school your mind then, that it may come to the rescue of
your feelings&mdash;and a great thing is to cultivate this love of
study while yet you are happy. For if you wait until you
need it to be happy, you will, with much more difficulty,
persuade yourself to forget yourself in it&mdash;Now as to particulars,
you need never worry yourself if you do not happen
to like what it is orthodox to prefer. You had much better
be honest with yourself even if wrong, than dishonest in
forcing yourself to agree with the multitude. That is, the
opinion one most commonly hears is not always the opinion
of the best. And again, always be able to give a reason for
what you think and, to a great extent, for what you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once he was fascinated by Japan, its people, their customs,
their tea-houses, gardens and their art. Much of this
was more novel to his friends at home when he wrote about
it than it would be now; although even at that time he saw
how much Tokyo had already been influenced by Western
ideas and habits. He kept his attention alert, observing,
studying, pondering everything that he saw or heard. In
fact, within a fortnight he lit upon two things that later led
to careful examination and the writing of books. In a letter
to his mother on June 8, in dealing with differences that
struck him between the people of Japan and occidentals, he
writes: &ldquo;Again, perhaps, a key to the Japanese is impersonalism.
Forced upon one&rsquo;s notice first in their speech, it may
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
be but the expression of character. In the Japanese language
there is no distinction of persons, no sex, no plural even.
I speak of course of their inflected speech. They have pronouns,
but these are used solely to prevent ambiguity. The
same is true of their genders and plurals. To suppose them,
however, destitute of feeling, as some have done, I am convinced
would be an error. The impersonalism I speak of
is a thing of the mind rather than the heart. I suggest
rather than posit.&rdquo; In a letter, three days later, he tells of
a friend whose jin-riki-sha man&rsquo;s wife had the fox disease,
&ldquo;a species of acute mania supposed by the people to be a
bewitchment by the fox. As the person possessed so regards
it and others assist in keeping up the delusion by interpreting
favorably to their own views, it is no wonder that the
superstition survives.&rdquo; Some years later an unexpected sight
of a religious trance on Mount Ontake gave rise to a careful
study of these psychic phenomena. Well did Pasteur remark
that in the fields of observation chance favors only the minds
that are prepared.</p>
<p>He hired a house in Tokyo, set up his own establishment
as if he had been born and bred there, and after three weeks
on shore wrote: &ldquo;I am beginning to talk Japanese like a
native (of America), and I take to ye manners and customs
of ye country like a duck to the water.&rdquo; He stayed enjoying
the life, and the many friends he made, until the middle of
July, when, with Professor Terry of the University, he
started on a trip across the mountains to the other side of
the island. The journey was hard, and at times the food
and lodging poor. &ldquo;Think,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;of the means of
subsistence in a land where there is no milk, no butter, no
cheese, no bread, almost no meat, and not over many eggs.
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Rice is the staple article of food, then vegetables, eggs and
fish; the last two being classed as the food of the richer,
and most eaten in the greater centres. Some country people
are so poor that they have not rice, and eat barley instead. It
is considered a sign of poverty to be without this universal
article of diet, but in travelling about in out-of-the-way corners
one meets with such places. I have myself lit upon such
at the noon-day halt but have never been obliged to spend
the night there.&rdquo; But the scenery was fine, and the people
unchanged by contact with the foreigner. He noted archaic
devices still in use for pumping and boiling water; yet, in
visiting a ruined castle, he saw that while the interior of the
country had as yet been little affected by the impact of the
West its political condition had been transformed with
amazing speed. &ldquo;We mounted through some seven barnlike
rooms, up Japanese ladders to the top story. Sitting by the
window and looking at the old feudal remains below, the
moat with its stagnant slime and the red dragon flies skimming
its surface, the old walls, the overgrown ramparts
where now the keeper tries to grow a crop of beans, all
tended to carry my thoughts back to the middle ages, or was
it only to my own boyhood when the name <i>middle ages</i>
almost stood for fairy land? And yet all this had been a
fact, even while I had been dreaming of it. My dreams of
Western feudalism had been co-existent with Eastern feudalism
itself. So it was only eleven years ago that the last
Daimio of the place left the castle of his ancestors forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From his journey across Japan he got back to Tokyo on
August 13th, where a surprise and an opportunity awaited
him. On the very evening of that day he was asked to accompany
a Special Mission from Korea to the United States
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
as its Foreign Secretary and Counsellor. About this Dr. W.
Sturgis Bigelow wrote to Percival&rsquo;s father:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;After two days of unconditional refusal and one of doubt
Percy has finally yielded to the wishes of the U. S. Legation here
and accepted the position of Foreign Secretary and General
Counsellor to the Embassy sent from Korea to the U. S.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The position practically amounts to his having complete
charge and control of the most important legation from a new
country that has visited the U. S. since the opening of Japan.
The U. S. authorities here are greatly pleased at having secured
so good a man, as is natural. There were many applicants for the
place.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to say the hesitation was mainly due to
anxiety to what his father would say, and adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He distrusts himself too much, he has great ability, he has
learned Japanese faster than I ever saw any man learn a language&mdash;and
he only needs to be assured that he is doing the right thing
to make a success of anything he undertakes, whether science or
diplomacy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br />KOREA</h2>
<p>It was the first diplomatic mission from the hermit kingdom
to any Western power, and they wanted someone with
<i>savoir faire</i> to look after them. He accepted the post, landing
in San Francisco with his charges on September 2nd, and
crossing to New York, where the Embassy was received by
President Arthur. After spending six weeks in the United
States he returned by the Pacific with the greater part of
his colleagues, reaching Japan in November. They felt
grateful for what he had done, and he was invited to go
on with them to Korea as the guest of the King&mdash;a chance
not to be lost, so he went, and after sundry wearisome delays
in transit came to S&ouml;ul, the capital of the Kingdom, just
before Christmas, 1883.</p>
<p>Evidently he had not intended so long a sojourn and study
as he was destined to make, for in a letter to his mother on
December the 20th, just after landing at Chemulpo, the
port of S&ouml;ul, he writes: &ldquo;I purpose to study the land a little
and then return overland either to Pusan&rdquo; (the Japanese
treaty port at the extreme southern end of the peninsula) &ldquo;or
after some travelling in the interior here, Gensan.&rdquo; He had as
yet no idea of the impossibility of travel in Korea in the winter,
especially for an occidental, but he learned it the following
day when with much discomfort he went half way to
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
S&ouml;ul, the whole distance from the port to the capital being
twenty-seven miles. Another and stronger reason for his prolonged
stay was the hospitality tendered and the solicitude
for his comfort. At Nagasaki, where the ship stopped on the
journey from Japan, his Korean colleagues, observing his
preference, engaged a Japanese familiar with European cooking
to become a member of his household, and they brought
along also chairs for his use. In the letter to his mother just
quoted he writes; &ldquo;I think I shall either take a house of my
own or, perhaps better, have a part of a Corean&rsquo;s to my exclusive
use.... I shall of course be asked to stay at our
minister Foote&rsquo;s, but I shall fight shy of it in order to be less
tied politically.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> You see there are national parties even in
this small state, and I think it best for me to be, at any
rate at first, on the cross benches. Out in the Far East the
ministers of foreign countries are always mixed up in national
politics, and Corea is no exception to the rule.&rdquo; A
shrewd observation in view of the fact that hardly a year
passed before there was bloodshed between the adherents
of China and Japan in the government, when the Japanese
legation was attacked and fought its way to the sea.</p>
<p>He found that there had been prepared for him a
house, or rather group of buildings forming a part of the
Foreign Office, of which he was formally a member as having
been Counsellor to the Embassy to America. &ldquo;From
the street,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;you enter a courtyard, then another,
then a garden, and so on, wall after wall, until you have
left the outside world far behind and are in a labyrinth of
your own. Before you lies a garden; behind another surrounded
by porticoes. Courtyards, gardens, porticoes, rooms,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
corridors in endless succession until you lose yourself in
the delightful maze.&rdquo; He speaks of the painting of landscapes
on the walls, of a door cut out as a circle in the wall
into which fit two sliding panels beautifully painted on both
sides. &ldquo;Floor, ceiling, walls all are paper. But you would
hardly imagine that what you tread upon, to all appearance
square stone slabs, is oil paper so hard as even in sounds
under your footfalls to resemble flags.... Through the
thick sliding windows sifts the golden light into the room,
and for the nonce you forget that outside is the dull grey
of a cloudy sky and a snow decked land of a December
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There he spent the winter under strangely favorable conditions;
one of the first men of European race to enter the
country with an official position and no official duties or
restraints, and a couple of officers detailed to care for him,
without hampering him by constant attendance on his
movements. In fact he seems to have been more free than
anyone in the land. It was beneath the dignity of a higher
official to go through the streets except in a palanquin; and
all others, save blind men, must not be out of their houses
after night-fall on pain of flogging. But finding that to be
carried squatting on the cold floor of a box two and a half
feet square was intolerable, he took to his feet; and, being
an official, he walked all over the city at any hour of the day
or night, without this foreign eccentricity shocking either
the high or the lowly. He was received in special audience
by the King and the Crown Prince, and later photographed
them; was visited and entertained abundantly, made many
acquaintances and some warm friends. On February 2nd,
he wrote to his mother: &ldquo;I think it will please your maternal
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
ear to hear of the esteem in which your boy is held and of
the honors and great kindness which are lavished upon him.
On New Year&rsquo;s Eve<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> he received some gifts from the King,
made on purpose for him, a description of which you will
find in a letter to Katie. They were accompanied by the
wish on the part of His Majesty &lsquo;that in view of my speedy
return, he hoped that I would come back next year.&rsquo; I had
informed them of my departure before long, which they do
not view favorably. I was also told that I was constantly in
the King&rsquo;s thoughts. He is hospitality and kindness itself
to everyone. I have seen several houses of the highest nobles
in the land and there is none to compare with the establishment
they have given me. I have been consulted on foreign
business, my requests for others granted, talked to on home
matters, in short I am looked upon as a friend of the government
and cared for in corresponding style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delightful as the experience was, there came over him in
time a desire to go back to more familiar surroundings, and
as spring approached he spoke of his intention. They tried
to dissuade him, and did induce him to delay his departure;
but at last he sailed with no little feeling of sadness in leaving
a country where he had been so kindly treated and
which he was never to see again. In a letter to his sister
Bessie, on February 17, not long before his departure he
wrote: &ldquo;I have already taken fifty-three negatives of scenes
in and about S&ouml;ul, groups and individuals. I am not only

<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br />HIS FIRST BOOK, &ldquo;CHOS&Ouml;N&rdquo;</h2>
<p>He did write the book, and published it in 1885, under
the title of &ldquo;Chos&ouml;n&mdash;the Land of the Morning Calm&mdash;A
Sketch of Korea&rdquo; It is an account of his personal experiences,
under peculiarly favorable conditions, in a land of Asiatic
civilization almost wholly unknown to the outer world, and
as such it was, and after fifty years remains, a highly interesting
book of travel. Although there is too much clever
play on words, a natural temptation to a brilliant young
writer, the story is graphically told, with much appreciation
and many poetic touches on men and scenes. But the book
is far more than this. It is a careful study of the land and
its people, their customs, ideas and manner of life. He describes
the geography of the country and of the walled capital,
then little known, the legends and government; the
houses and mode of life of the upper and lower classes, then
sharply distinguished; the architecture, landscape gardening
and costumes, some of them very peculiar; for while
much of the civilization had been derived from China, and
parts of it bore a close relation to the conditions in Japan,
it was in many ways quite distinct and unlike anything else
even in the Far East. Three things struck him greatly, as
lying at the base of the mode of life, and these he called the
triad of principles. They were the strange lack of individual
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
variation, which he called the quality of impersonality, of
which we shall hear more in connection with the Japanese;
the patriarchal system, with the rules of inheritance and the
relation of children to the fathers, which was carried very
far; and the position of women, in which the principle of
exclusion, universal as it is in Asia, was more rigidly enforced
than elsewhere in the Far East.</p>
<p>He was also impressed by the absence of what we understand
by religion, in substance or in manifestation, unless
the ethics of Confucius can be so called. Save for a few
monasteries there were no ecclesiastical buildings, no
temples, no services, public or observable. Buddhist priests
had long been excluded from the walled cities, and the
ancient cult that developed into Shinto in Japan died out or
never developed. On the other hand, there was a general
belief in a multitude of demons, some good, but, so far as
they affected man, evil for the most part, and kept away by
trivial devices, like images of beasts on the roofs and wisps
of straw over the doors.</p>
<p>How he succeeded in acquiring all the knowledge set
forth in the book it is difficult to conceive, for he was there
only about two months, came with the slight knowledge
of the language he could have picked up from his colleagues
on the Mission to America; and there were only two
men, it would seem, who could speak both Korean and any
European tongue,&mdash;one of them a German in the Foreign
Office, and the other an English schoolmaster who had been
there but a short time. His chief source of information must
have come through people who spoke Korean and Japanese,
but his own knowledge of the latter was still very limited,
for he had spent only a few months in Japan, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
his secretary, Tsunejiro Miyaoka, afterward a distinguished
lawyer in Tokyo, who knew English, was desperately ill
almost all the time he was in Korea. To have absorbed and
displayed so clearly all the information in &ldquo;Chos&ouml;n&rdquo; makes
that work, if not one of his greatest contributions to knowledge,
yet a remarkable feat. Most books of travel are soon
superseded, but this one has a distinct permanent value, because
the life he portrays, especially that of the upper class,
which was almost all connected with the holding of public
office, has been swept away, never to reappear, by the conquest
and ultimate incorporation of the country by Japan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br />THE COUP D&rsquo;ETAT AND THE JAPANESE MARCH TO THE SEA</h2>
<p>One more event in Korea interested him deeply, for it
meant life or death to some of his nearest native friends, and
under the title of &ldquo;A Korean Coup d&rsquo;Etat,&rdquo; he gave a graphic
account of it in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for November 1886.
Although not himself present, since it took place in the
December after he had left, it was not unconnected with
the Mission to America of which he had been a member;
for the policy of opening Korea to the world had not met
with universal favor among the officials, and all those who
had gone on the Mission did not take it very seriously. In
fact the two groups rapidly drew apart, one side seeking to
extend foreign contacts and the use of foreign methods, the
other preparing to resist this. The latter began to strengthen
themselves by enrolling what they called a militia,&mdash;really
a rough body of men devoted to their interests,&mdash;until the
progressionists, as their opponents were called, saw that they
would be crushed unless they struck quickly. Among their
leaders was Hong Y&ouml;ng Sik, who had been especially attentive
to Percival during his stay in S&ouml;ul, and he with his partisans
decided to get control of affairs by the method
whereby changes of ministry are often effected at a certain
stage of political evolution, that is, by removing objectionable
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
ministers both from office and from the world. The
occasion selected was a banquet to celebrate the creation
of a post office, that institution being regarded as typical
of good or evil in foreign habits. The chief victim was
wounded but not killed, whereat the progressionist leaders,
pretending to be alarmed for the safety of the King, went
to the palace and slew such of the leading opponents as they
could lay their hands on; but, having no troops, sent in His
Majesty&rsquo;s name to ask the Japanese minister for the protection
of his force of one hundred and twenty guards. Not
suspecting the real nature of the disturbance, he complied,
but was soon attacked by a body of six hundred Chinese soldiers,
naturally in sympathy with the conservatives, and at
their back the Korean militia. For two days the Japanese
guards held off the assailants with little loss to themselves
compared with that of their foes, until the King placed
himself in the hands of the Korean militia, when there was
nothing for the Japanese to do but to get back to their legation
as best they could. The rest of the tale he felt so much
and told so well in the ephemeral form of a magazine article
that it is given here in his own words:<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Night had already wrapped the city in gloom, as the
column defiled from the palace gate into the black and tortuous
streets of the town. No resistance was made to their
exit, for, under cover of the darkness, the Korean soldiers
had all secretly slipped away. A pall-like obscurity and
silence had settled over everything. It seemed the spirit of
death. The streets of S&ouml;ul are for the most part hardly more
than wide alleys, crooked and forbidding enough in the daytime.
Night converts them into long cavernous passages,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
devoid of light, like the underground ramifications of some
vast cave; for, by a curious curfew law, they are denied
any artificial illumination. Through this sombre labyrinth
the Japanese column threaded its way, with nothing to light
its path but the reflection in the sky of fires in distant parts
of the city,&mdash;a weird canopy to an inky blackness. Before
long, however, even night failed to yield security from man.
At the cross-roads and wherever a side-street offered an opportunity
for attack were gathered bands of braves, mixed
masses of soldiers and populace, who fired upon them or
hurled stones, according to the character of the individuals.
Still they pushed steadily forward, though utterly uncertain
what they might find at their journey&rsquo;s end; for they had
not been able to hear from the legation since the attack on
the palace, and were in grave fear for its safety. As they
came to the top of a bit of rising ground, they made out by
the lurid light of the fires their own flag, the red ball on the
white field, flying from its flagstaff, and thus learnt for the
first time that the buildings were still standing and in Japanese
hands. As they neared the legation the crowds increased,
but, sweeping them aside, the troops at length
reached their destination at eight o&rsquo;clock at night, having
been absent forty-eight hours.</p>
<p>That the legation was yet safe was not due to any neglect
or forbearance on the part of the Koreans. From the moment
of the attempted assassination of Min Y&ouml;ng Ik, the
city had fallen a prey to disturbances that grew hourly graver
and graver in character, and began to be directed more and
more against the Japanese merchants and traders scattered
through the town. Such of these as took alarm first hastened
to the legation for protection. In this way about seventy
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
of them had collected in the buildings, and they, together
with the servants and a score of soldiers that had been left
there, had successfully defended the place until the return
of the troops. For two whole days the little improvised garrison
had kept the besiegers at bay.</p>
<p>The legation was safe, but for the rest it was a melancholy
tale which the minister and his suite returned to hear.
The sullen glow in the heavens, that had served them for
torches across the city, came, they learned, from the burning
by the infuriated rabble of the homes of their compatriots.
But worse than the loss of property had been the loss
of life. The hatred of the Japanese, that had lain smouldering
for centuries, had at last found a vent. Shortly after
the attack on the palace by the Chinese troops, the cry was
raised against the Japanese, and a wholesale pillage and
massacre of the foreigners began....</p>
<p>The Japanese gone, the progressionist ministers, realizing
that they had failed, fled hastily to such concealment as individual
ingenuity suggested.... One alone remained to
die at his post. The account of his death, given by certain
private Korean letters, is a tale of as noble an act of heroism
as was ever performed.</p>
<p>When it became evident that the Japanese would withdraw,
and the progressionist leaders be left to their fate,
the latter, perceiving that if they remained they must inevitably
fall into the hands of the enemy, prepared for flight.
To the surprise and horror of all the others, Hong Y&ouml;ng
Sik calmly informed them that he should stay. The rest,
indeed, had better go, but one, he thought, ought to remain,
to show the world that the progressionists were not rebels
nor ashamed of the principles they had professed, and he
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
would be that one. The others, aghast at his resolve, tried
their utmost to dissuade him, but all to no purpose. Each in
turn then offered to stay in his place, but he would not hear
of it. It was more fitting, he replied, that he should remain,
because one of the oldest (he was just thirty years of age);
and forthwith, to signify that his resolve was unalterable,
he drew off his long court boots. Finding it impossible to
shake his determination, and fearing lest, if they delayed
longer, they might not escape themselves, they reluctantly
left him and fled. There in the palace, awaiting his certain
doom, the Chinese soldiers found him, a few minutes after.
They seized him and carried him to the Chinese camp,
where, with some show of formality, he was publicly executed.
Thus died a brave and loyal soul, true with his life
to the principles he had publicly professed, and which he
deemed it cowardly and wicked to abandon....</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Japanese lay imprisoned within their legation
buildings, closely besieged by the Koreans. Toward the
middle of the day, on the seventh, they discovered that their
provisions were nearly exhausted. Only the soldiers, therefore,
were allowed rice, the rest getting for their portion the
water in which the rice had previously been boiled. There
were now in the compound one hundred and forty soldiers,
thirty servants attached to the legation, about seventy merchants
and artisans, besides many other Japanese residents
from the city, who had sought refuge in the buildings. It was
utterly impossible to procure more provisions. Starvation
stared the prisoners in the face, even if they should contrive to
hold out against the assaults of the Koreans. Reports now
reached them that all the gates of S&ouml;ul had been closed, and
that preparations were everywhere in progress for a general
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
attack. It was also rumored that this would take place at
dusk, and that under cover of the darkness the legation
would be fired by the foe.</p>
<p>Thereupon, Takezoye held a council of war, at which it
was decided that the legation&rsquo;s only hope, desperate as it
was deemed, lay in forcing a passage through the western
gate of the city, and retreating as best they might to Chemulpo.
Accordingly, at the close of the conference the order
was given to withdraw from S&ouml;ul. It was now discovered
that the messenger to whom the letters were entrusted had
been afraid to leave the legation. Doomed indeed seemed the
ill-starred Korean attempt at a postal system to bring mishap
upon everything connected with it, both big and little,
new and old.</p>
<p>Takezoye then addressed the Japanese gathered in the
court-yard. He told them that his guards had been obliged,
in defense of the king on the preceding day, to fire upon the
Chinese soldiers, who had broken into the palace and opened
fire upon the royal apartments; that the Korean troops and
people had now combined against the Japanese; that the
Korean government was apparently powerless to protect
them; that the legation was blockaded; that it was impossible
longer to carry on the ministerial functions; and that
he had resolved to retire upon Chemulpo, there to await instructions
from Japan. All the confidential dispatches and
other private documents belonging to the legation were then
burned.</p>
<p>It was now half past two in the afternoon. The crowd
without was steadily growing larger and larger, and closing
in slowly but surely about the devoted compound. Suddenly,
to its amazement, the outer wooden gates, so stoutly
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
defended a few minutes before, swung inward; there was
a moment&rsquo;s hush of expectation, and the Japanese column,
grim with determination, defiled in marching order into
the street. It was a sight to stir the most sluggish soul. Instinctively
the Koreans fell back, awed as they read the desperate
resolve in the faces of the men; and the column kept
silently, surely, moving on. First came two detachments,
forming the van; then the minister, his suite, the women and
children, followed, placed in the centre and guarded on
either hand by rows of soldiers. Next marched the secretaries
and the subordinate officials of the legation, all armed,
and with them the merchants and artisans, carrying the
wounded and the ammunition. Two more detachments
brought up the rear. Debouching into the main road, the
body struck out for the western gate. The Koreans, who
crowded the side-streets, the court-yards, and even the roofs
of the houses, had by this time recovered from their first
daze, and began to attack the column on all sides, firing and
throwing stones. So poor was their aim, however, and so
unused were they to the business, that neither bullets nor
stones did the Japanese much harm. The vanguard, lying
down in the road, fired at the assailants and drove them
back, and the march proceeded. Nothing could stop the
advance of the van, and the rear-guard as ably covered the
rear. Slowly but surely the column pushed on.</p>
<p>It had thus got half-way across the city, when it encountered
a more formidable obstruction. Opposite the old palace,
where a broad avenue from the palace gates entered the
road it was following, a detachment of the left division of
the Korean army had been drawn up, to prevent, if possible,
all escape. The spot was well chosen. On one side
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
lay the army barracks of the left division, a safe retreat in
case of failure, while in front stretched the broad, open
space of the avenue, ending in the highway along which the
Japanese were obliged to pass. To make the most of this
position a field-piece had been brought out and trained on
the cross-road, and deployed beside it the Koreans posted
themselves, and waited for the coming column. As the foreigners
came into view, marching across the end of the
avenue, the Koreans opened fire upon them both with the
field-piece and with small arms. The effect should have been
frightful. As a matter of fact it was <i>nil</i>, owing to the same
cause as before, the bullets passing some twenty feet over
the heads of the Japanese. Not a single man was killed, and
only a few were slightly wounded. The rear-guard, prone
in the street or under cover of the little gutter-moats, a peculiar
feature of all Korean city streets, calmly took accurate
aim, and eventually forced this body of the enemy back into
their barracks. Still harassed at every step by other troops and
by the populace, the column, advancing steadily in spite of
them, at last gained the west gate. It was shut, bolted, and
guarded by Korean soldiers. A sudden onset of the vanguard
put these to flight. Some of the soldiers, armed with
axes, then severed the bars, demolished the heavy wooden
doors, and the column passed through. Keeping up a fire
on the foe, who still pursued, the Japanese then made for
the principal ferry of the river Han, at a place called Marpo,
one of the river suburbs of the city. As they turned there
to look back toward S&ouml;ul, they saw smoke rising from the
direction of the legation, and knew from this that the buildings
had already been fired. With the rear-guard set to
protect the important points, they proceeded to cross the
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
stream. Seizing this opportunity, a parting attack was now
made by a conglomerate collection of Korean troops and
tramps, who had pursued them from the city. Hovering on
their flanks, these fired at the ferry boats as they passed over;
but the Japanese rear-guard shot at and killed some of them,
and so succeeded in keeping the others at bay. By about
half past five in the afternoon the Japanese had completed
the crossing. After this no further serious opposition was
made to their retreat, and, following the ordinary road and
marching the whole night, they reached the hill above
Chemulpo, and looked down upon the broad expanse of the
Yellow Sea at seven o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the eighth.</p>
<p>The long, hard fight was over; an end had come at last.
They saw it in the sea stretched out at their feet, just awaking
from its lethargy at the touch of the morning light. To
them its gently heaving bosom spoke of their own return
to life. No crazy fishing boat now stood between them and
theirs. One of their own men-of-war lay at anchor in the
offing. There she rode, in all her stately beauty, the smoke
curling faintly upward from her funnel, waiting to bear
them across the water to the arms of those who held them
dear. And the sparkling shimmer, as the rays of the rising
sun tinged the Yellow Sea with gold in one long pathway
eastward, seemed Japan&rsquo;s own welcome sent to greet them,
a proud, fond smile from home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br />THE SOUL OF THE FAR EAST</h2>
<p>Back in Japan in the early spring of 1884, Percival
stayed there until midsummer, when he turned his face
homeward and westward, for he had crossed the Pacific
three times and preferred to go home the other way. Touching
at Shanghai and Hong Kong he stopped off at Singapore
to make a detour to Java, which delayed him so much that
he saw only the southern part of India. At Bombay he
stayed with Charles Lowell, a cousin and class-mate, in
charge of the branch there of the Comptoir d&rsquo;Escompte of
Paris; thence his route led through the Red Sea and Alexandria
to Venice, where to his annoyance he was quarantined;
not, as he sarcastically remarks, because he came
from an infected country, but on account of cholera in the
city itself. Finally he went home by way of Paris and London.</p>
<p>At this time he had clearly decided to write his book on
Korea; for in his letters, and in memoranda in his letter
book, are found many pages that appear afterwards therein.
But he certainly had not lost his interest in mathematics
or physics, for any casual observation would quickly bring
it out. From the upper end of the Red Sea he sees a cloud
casting a shadow on the desert toward Sinai, and proceeds
to show how by the angle of elevation of the cloud, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
angle of the sun, and the distance to the place where the
shadow falls one can compute the height of the cloud. He
looks at the reflection of the moon along the water and
points out why, when there is a ripple on the surface, the
track of light does not run directly toward the moon but to
windward of it. All this was a matter of general intellectual
alertness in a mind familiar with the subject, but there
is as yet no indication that he had any intention of turning
his attention to scientific pursuits. On the contrary, two
letters written on this journey appear to show that he regarded
literature, in a broad sense, as the field he proposed
to enter, and with this his publications for several years to
come accord.</p>
<p>In a letter from Bombay to Frederic J. Stimson,&mdash;a classmate
who had already won his spurs by his pen, and was
destined to go far,&mdash;he begins by speaking of his friend&rsquo;s
writings, then of the subject in general, and finally turns
to himself and says: &ldquo;Somebody wrote me the other day
apropos of what I may or may not write, that facts not reflections
were the thing. Facts not reflections indeed. Why
that is what most pleases mankind from the philosopher to
the fair; one&rsquo;s own reflections on or from things. Are we to
forego the splendor of the French salon which returns us
beauty from a score of different points of view from its mirrors
more brilliant than their golden settings. The fact gives
us but a flat image. It is our reflections upon it that make it a
solid truth. For every truth is many-sided. It has many
aspects. We know now what was long unknown, that true
seeing is done with the mind from the comparatively
meagre material supplied by the eye....</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that all writing should be a collection of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
precious stones of truth which is beauty. Only the arrangement
differs with the character of the book. You string them
into a necklace for the world at large. You pigeon-hole them
into drawers for the scientist. In the necklace you have the
calling of your thought; <i>i.e.</i>, the expressing of it and the
arrangement of the thoughts among themselves. I wonder
how many men are fortunate enough to have them come
as they are wanted. A question by the bye nearly incapable
of solution because what seems good to one man, does not
begin to satisfy the next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A month later he writes to his mother from Paris on October
7th: &ldquo;As for me, I wish I could believe a little more in
myself. It is at all times the one thing needful. As it is I
often get discouraged. You will&mdash;said Bigelow the other day
to me in Japan. There will be times when you will feel like
tearing the whole thing up and lighting your pipe with
the wreck. Don&rsquo;t you do it. Put it away and take it out
again at a less destructive moment.&rdquo; Then, speaking of
what his mother had written him, he says: &ldquo;But I shall most
certainly act upon your excellent advice and what is more
you shall have the exquisite ennui of reading it before it
goes to print and then you know we can have corrections
and improvements by the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching Boston in the autumn of 1884, he made it his
headquarters for the next four years. The period was far from
an idle one; for, apart from business matters that engaged
his attention, he was actively at work on two books: First,
the &ldquo;Chos&ouml;n,&rdquo; that study already described of Korea and
the account of his own sojourn there. The preface to this is
dated November 1885, and the publication was early in the
following year. The second book,&mdash;smaller in size and type,
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
and without illustrations,&mdash;is the most celebrated of his
writings on the Orient. Its title, &ldquo;The Soul of the Far East,&rdquo;
denotes aptly its object in the mind of the author, for it is
an attempt to portray what appeared to him the essential
and characteristic difference between the civilizations of
Eastern Asia and Western Europe. From an early time in
his stay in Japan he had been impressed by what he called
the impersonality of the people, the comparative absence,
both in aspiration and in conduct, of diversified individual
self-expression among them. The more he thought about
it the stronger this impression became; and this book is a
study of the subject in its various manifestations.</p>
<p>First comes a general discussion of the meaning and
essence of individuality, with the deduction that the Japanese
suffer from arrested development; that they have always
copied but not assimilated; added but not incorporated
the additions into their own civilization, like a tree into
which have been grafted great branches while the trunk remains
unchanged. &ldquo;The traits that distinguished these peoples
in the past have been gradually extinguishing them
ever since. Of these traits, stagnating influences upon their
career, perhaps the most important is the great quality of
impersonality&rdquo;; and later he adds, &ldquo;Upon this quality as a
foundation rests the Far Oriental character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then proceeds to demonstrate, or illustrate, his thesis
from many aspects of Japanese life, beginning with the
family. He points out that no one has a personal birthday
or even age of his own, two days in the year being treated
as universal birthdays, one for girls and the other for boys,
the latter, in May, being the occasion when hollow paper
fish are flown from poles over every house where a boy
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
has been born during the preceding year. Everyone, moreover,
is credited with a year&rsquo;s advance in age on New Year&rsquo;s
Day quite regardless of the actual date of his birth. If a
youth &ldquo;belongs to the middle class, as soon as his schooling&rdquo;
in the elements of the Classics &ldquo;is over he is set to learn his
father&rsquo;s trade. To undertake to learn any trade but his
father&rsquo;s would strike the family as simply preposterous.&rdquo;
But to whatever class he may belong he is taught the duty
of absolute subordination to the head of the family, for the
family is the basis of social life in the Far East. Marriage,
with us a peculiarly personal matter, is in the East a thing
in which the young people have no say whatever; it is
a business transaction conducted by the father through
marriage brokers. A daughter becoming on marriage a
part of her husband&rsquo;s family ceases to be a member of her
own, and her descendants are no benefit to it, unless, perchance,
having no brothers, one of her sons is adopted by
her father. Thus it is that when a child is born the general
joy &ldquo;depends somewhat upon the sex. If the baby
chances to be a boy, everybody is immensely pleased; if
a girl there is considerably less effusion shown. In the
latter case the more impulsive relatives are unmistakably
sorry; the more philosophic evidently hope for better luck
next time. Both kinds make very pretty speeches, which
not even the speakers believe, for in the babe lottery the
family is considered to have drawn a blank. A delight so
engendered proves how little of the personal, even in prospective,
attaches to its object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the fourth chapter he takes up the question of language,
bringing out his point with special effect, showing the absence
of personal pronouns, and indeed of everything that
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
indicates an expression of individuality or even of sex, replacing
them by honorifics which occur in the most surprising
way. But the matter of language, though highly
significant, is somewhat technical, and his discussion can
be left to those who care to follow it in his book.</p>
<p>He turns next to nature and to art, pointing out how genuine,
how universal, and at the same time how little individual,
how impersonal, is the Japanese love of those things.
Of them he says &ldquo;that nature, not man, is their <i>beau id&eacute;al</i>,
the source to them of inspiration, is evident again in looking
at their art.&rdquo; Incidentally, the account of the succession
of flower festivals throughout the year is a beautiful
piece of descriptive writing, glowing with the color it portrays
and the delight of the throngs of visitors.</p>
<p>On the subject of religion he has much to say. Shintoism,
though generally held by the people, and causing great numbers
of them to go as pilgrims to the sacred places on mountain
tops, he regards as not really a religion. That is the reason
it is not inconsistent with Buddhism. &ldquo;It is not simply that
the two contrive to live peaceably together; they are actually
both of them implicitly believed by the same individual.
Millions of Japanese are good Buddhists and good Shintoists
at the same time. That such a combination should be
possible is due to the essential difference in the character of
the two beliefs. The one is extrinsic, the other intrinsic, in
its relations to the human soul. Shintoism tells a man but
little about himself and his hereafter; Buddhism, little but
about himself and what he may become. In examining
Far Eastern religion, therefore, for personality, or the reverse,
we may dismiss Shintoism as having no particular
bearing upon the subject.&rdquo; Turning to the other system he
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
says: &ldquo;At first sight Buddhism is much more like Christianity
than those of us who stay at home and speculate upon it
commonly appreciate. As a system of philosophy it sounds
exceedingly foreign, but it looks unexpectedly familiar as
a faith.&rdquo; After dwelling upon the resemblances in the popular
attitude, he continues: &ldquo;But behind all this is the religion
of the few,&mdash;of those to whom sensuous forms cannot suffice
to represent super-sensuous cravings; whose god is something
more than an anthropomorphic creation; to whom
worship means not the cramping of the body, but the expansion
of the soul.&rdquo;... &ldquo;In relation to one&rsquo;s neighbor
the two beliefs are kin, but as regards one&rsquo;s self, as far apart
as the West is from the East. For here, at this idea of self,
we are suddenly aware of standing on the brink of a fathomless
abyss, gazing giddily down into that great gulf
which divides Buddhism from Christianity. We cannot see
the bottom. It is a separation more profound than death;
it seems to necessitate annihilation. To cross it we must bury
in its depths all we know as ourselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christianity is a personal religion; Buddhism, an impersonal
one. In this fundamental difference lies the worldwide
opposition of the two beliefs. Christianity tells us to
purify ourselves that we may enjoy countless aeons of that
bettered self hereafter; Buddhism would have us purify
ourselves that we may lose all sense of self for evermore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of this chapter he sums up his demonstration
thus: &ldquo;We have seen, then, how in trying to understand
these peoples we are brought face to face with impersonality
in each of those three expressions of the human soul, speech,
thought, yearning. We have looked at them first from a
social standpoint. We have seen how singularly little regard
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
is paid the individual from his birth to his death. How he
lives his life long the slave of patriarchal customs of so
puerile a tendency as to be practically impossible to a people
really grown up. How he practises a wholesale system of
adoption sufficient of itself to destroy any surviving regard
for the ego his other relations might have left. How in his
daily life he gives the minimum of thought to the bettering
himself in any worldly sense, and the maximum of polite
consideration to his neighbor. How, in short, he acts toward
himself as much as possible as if he were another, and to
that other as if he were himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, not content with standing stranger-like upon the
threshold, we have sought to see the soul of their civilization
in its intrinsic manifestations. We have pushed our inquiry,
as it were, one step nearer its home. And the same trait that
was apparent sociologically has been exposed in this our
antipodal phase of psychical research. We have seen how
impersonal is his language, the principal medium of communication
between one soul and another; how impersonal
are the communings of his soul with itself. How the man
turns to nature instead of to his fellowman in silent sympathy.
And how, when he speculates upon his coming
castles in the air, his most roseate desire is to be but an indistinguishable
particle of the sunset clouds and vanish invisible
as they into the starry stillness of all-embracing space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what does this strange impersonality betoken?
Why are these peoples so different from us in this most fundamental
of considerations to any people, the consideration
of themselves? The answer leads to some interesting conclusions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final chapter is entitled &ldquo;Imagination,&rdquo; for he regards
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
this as the source of all progress, and the far orientals as
particularly unimaginative. Their art he ascribes to appreciation
rather than originality. They are, he declares, less
advanced than the occidentals, their rate of progress is less
rapid and the individuals are more alike; and he concludes
that unless their newly imported ideas really take root they
will vanish &ldquo;off the face of the earth and leave our planet
the eventual possession of the dwellers where the day declines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One cannot deny that he made a strong case for the impersonality
of the Japanese; and if it be thought that his
conclusions therefrom were unfriendly it must be remembered
that he had a deep admiration and affection for that
people, wishing them well with all his heart.</p>
<p>Without attempting to survey the reviews and criticisms
of the book, which was translated into many languages,
it may be interesting to recall the comments of three Europeans
of very diverse qualities and experiences. Dr. Pierre
Janet, the great French neurologist, said to a friend of the
author that as a study of Japanese mentality it seemed to
him to show more insight than any other he had ever read
on the subject.</p>
<p>The second commentator is Lafcadio Hearn, a very different
type of person, given to enthusiasm. He had not yet
been to Japan, and &ldquo;The Soul of the Far East&rdquo; had much
to do with his going there. In his book &ldquo;Concerning Lafcadio
Hearn&rdquo; George M. Gould says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should not have succeeded in getting Hearn to attempt
Japan had it not been for a little book that fell into his
hands during the stay with me. Beyond question, Mr. Lowell&rsquo;s
volume had a profound influence in turning his attention to Japan
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
and greatly aided me in my insistent urging him to go there. In
sending the book Hearn wrote me this letter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gooley!&mdash;I have found a marvellous book,&mdash;a book of books!&mdash;a
colossal, splendid, godlike book. You must read every line of
it. For heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t skip a word of it. The book is called
&ldquo;The Soul of the Far East,&rdquo; but its title is smaller than its imprint.</p>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="sc">Hearneyboy</span></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S. Let something else go to H&mdash;, and read this book instead.
May God eternally bless and infinitely personalize the
man who wrote this book! Please don&rsquo;t skip one solitary line
of it, and don&rsquo;t delay reading it,&mdash;because something, much! is
going to go out of this book into your heart and life and stay
there! I have just finished this book and feel like John in
Patmos,&mdash;only a d&mdash;&mdash;d sight better. He who shall skip one
word of this book let his portion be cut off and his name blotted
out of the Book of Life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hearn had read the book on Korea and was impressed by
that also, for in a letter of 1889, he wrote, after commenting
on another work he had been reading, &ldquo;How luminous and
psychically electric is Lowell&rsquo;s book compared with it. And
how much nobler a soul must be the dreamer of Chos&ouml;n!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>After living in Japan Hearn came to different conclusions
about Percival&rsquo;s ideas on the impersonality of the Japanese,
but he never lost his admiration for the book or its author.
In May, 1891, he writes;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lowell has, I think, no warmer admirer in the world than
myself, though I do not agree with his theory in &ldquo;The Soul of the
Far East,&rdquo; and think he has ignored the most essential and astonishing
quality of the race: its genius of eclecticism.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>And again,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am not vain enough to think I can ever write anything
so beautiful as his &ldquo;Chos&ouml;n&rdquo; or &ldquo;Soul of the Far East,&rdquo; and will
certainly make a poor showing beside his precise, fine, perfectly
worded work.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, finally, as late as 1902 he speaks of it as &ldquo;incomparably
the greatest of all books on Japan, and the deepest.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>The third European critic to be quoted is Dr. Clay Macauley,
a Unitarian missionary to Japan, who had been a
friend of Percival&rsquo;s there, and after his death at Flagstaff in
1916 was still at work among the Japanese. On January 24,
1917, he read before the Asiatic Society of Japan a Memorial
to him, in which he gave an estimate of &ldquo;The Soul of the
Far East&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The year after the publication of &ldquo;Cho-son,&rdquo; the book which
has associated Lowell most closely with a critical and interpretative
study of the peoples and institutions of this part of the
world, appeared his much-famed &ldquo;Soul of the Far East.&rdquo; I have
no time for an extended critique of this marvellous ethnic essay.
&ldquo;Marvellous&rdquo; I name it, not only because of the startling message
it bears and the exquisitely fascinating speech by which the message
is borne, but also because of the revelation it gives of the
distinctive mental measure and the characteristic personality of
the author himself ... the book is really a marvellous psychical
study. However, in reading it today, the critical reader should, all
along, keep in mind the time and conditions under which Lowell
wrote. His judgment of &ldquo;The Soul of the Far East&rdquo; was made
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
fully a generation ago. Time has brought much change to all
Oriental countries since then, especially to this &ldquo;Land of the Rising
Sun.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then refers to the author&rsquo;s conviction that owing to
their impersonality the Oriental people, if unchanged and
unless their newly imported ideas take root, would disappear
before the advancing nations of the West, and proceeds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now, notice Lowell&rsquo;s &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;unless.&rdquo; He had passed his
judgment; but he saw a possible transformation. And I know
that he hailed the incoming into the East of the motive forces of
the West as forerunner of a possible ascendancy here of the
genius of the world&rsquo;s advancing civilization, prophetic of that
New East into which, now, the Far East is becoming wonderously
changed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Japan certainly is not in a process of disappearing before
the advancing nations of the West; but it may be that this
is not because her people have radically changed their
nature. The arts of the West, civil and military, they have
thoroughly acquired; but Percival Lowell may have been
right in his diagnosis and wrong in his forecast. His estimate
of their temperament may have been correct, and the
conclusion therefrom of their destiny erroneous. The
strange identity with which all Japanese explain the recent
international events is not inconsistent with his theory of
impersonality, and it may be that from a national standpoint
this is less a source of weakness than of strength.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br />SECOND VISIT TO JAPAN</h2>
<p>Having got &ldquo;The Soul of the Far East&rdquo; off his hands, and
into those of the public, in 1888, he sailed in December for
Japan, arriving on January the eighth. As usual he took
a house in Tokyo and on January 23 he writes to his mother
about it. &ldquo;My garden is a miniature range of hills on one
side, a dry pond on the other. One plum tree is blooming
now, another comes along shortly, and a cherry tree
will peep into my bedroom window all a-blush toward the
beginning of April. A palm tree exists with every appearance
of comfort in front of the drawing room, a foreground
for the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fictitious employment by the Japanese has developed
into a real one most amusingly&mdash;You know by the existing
law a foreigner is not allowed to live outside of the foreign
reservation unless in the service of some native body, governmental
or private. Now Chamberlain got a Mr. Masujima
to arrange matters. The plan that occurred to him, Masujima,
was to employ me to lecture before the School of
Languages of which he, Masujima, is President. It was
thought better to make the thing in part real, a suggestion
I liked, and the upshot of it is that I am booked to deliver
a lecture a week until I see fit to change. Chamberlain and
Masujima cooked up between them the idea of translating
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
my initial performance and then inserting it in a reader
of lectures, sermons and such in the colloquiae which Chamberlain
is preparing&mdash;Subject&mdash;A homily to the students to
become superior Japanese rather than inferior Europeans.
Curious if you will in view of the fact that Masujima himself
is madly in love with foreigners and as C. says is a sort
of universal solvent for their quandaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>January 1889 proved a peculiarly fortunate time to arrive,
for most interesting events were about to take place, as he
soon wrote to his old college chum, Harcourt Amory, on
February 21:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things have been happening since I arrived. Indeed I
could hardly have lit upon a more eventful month&mdash;from
doings of the Son of Heaven to those of Mother Earth&mdash;the
transmigration from the old to the new palace, the ceremony
of the promulgation of the Constitution, and the
earthquake, and the assassination of Mori&mdash;and his burial
the most huge affair of years. How he was murdered on
the morning of the great national event just as he was setting
out for the palace by a fanatic in the ante-chamber of
his own house because two years ago he trod on the mats
at Ise with his boots and poked the curtains aside with his
cane&mdash;you have probably already heard&mdash;For the affair was
too dramatic to have escaped European and American newspapers.
The to us significant part of the story is the quasi
sublatent approval of large numbers of Japanese. The whole
procedure of the assassin commends itself in method to their
ideas of the way to do it. The long cherished plan, the visit
to the temples of Ise for corroboration of facts, the selection
of the day, the coolness shown beforehand, the facing
of death in return, the very blows &agrave; la hari-kiri etc., all tout-a-fait
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
comme il faut. How he went to a joroya (house of
prostitution) the night before, saying that he wished to
have experienced as many phases of life as possible before
leaving it, how the official who received him at Mori&rsquo;s house
(he introduced himself by the story that he had come to
warn Mori of a plot to assassinate him) could recall no signs
of nervousness in him, except that he lifted his teacup to
drink once or twice after he had emptied it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole affair appeals to their imaginations, showing
still a pretty state of society. They also admire the beautiful
way the guard killed him, decapitating him in the good
old-fashioned way just leaving his head hanging to his
neck by a strip&mdash;Pleasing details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story of the murder of Mori, and of the public
festivities that were going on at the time, he told under the
title of &ldquo;The Fate of a Japanese Reformer&rdquo; in the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i> for November 1890. It is perhaps the best of
his descriptive writings, for the tragedy and its accessories
are full of striking contrasts which he brought out with
great effect. After a prelude on the danger of attempting
changes too rapidly, he gives a brief account of the life of
Mori Arinori; how in his youth he was selected to study
abroad, how he did so in America, and became enamored
of occidental ways, returning in time for the revolution that
restored the Mikado. He threw himself into the new movement,
rose in office, and, as he did so, strove to carry out
his ideas. He was the first to propose disarming the <i>samurai</i>,
which against bitter opposition was accomplished. As
Minister of Education he excluded religion from all national
instruction. He even suggested that the native language
should be superseded by a modified English, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
American people to adopt the changes also; but the plan
obtained no support on either side of the Pacific.</p>
<p>The Japanese reformers felt that like almost all Western
nations Japan should have a written constitution, and they
set the date for its promulgation at February 11th, 1889. This
Percival thought a mistake since it was the festival of Jimmu
Tenno, the mythic founder of the imperial house. Nevertheless,
the reformers, who had virtual control of the government,
determined that the two celebrations should take
place on the same day; and he describes the gorgeous decoration
of the city as he saw it, the functions attending the
grant of the constitution, and processions of comic chariots
in honor of Jimmu Tenno. To a foreigner the strange mixture
of native and partially imitated European costumes was
irresistibly funny; but the populace enjoyed themselves.
&ldquo;The rough element,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;so inevitable elsewhere was
conspicuously absent. There is this great gain among a relatively
less differentiated people. If you miss with regret the
higher brains, you miss with pleasure the lower brutes.
<i>Bons enfants</i> the Japanese are to a man. They gather delight
as men have learned to extract sugar, from almost anything....
As the twilight settled over the city, a horrible
rumor began to creep through the streets. During the day
the thing would seem to have shrunk before the mirth of
the masses, but under the cover of gloom it spread like night
itself over the town. It passed from mouth to mouth with
something of the shudder with which a ghost might come
and go. Viscount Mori, Minister of State for Education, had
been murdered that morning in his own house....</p>
<p>&ldquo;What had happened was this:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While Viscount Mori was dressing, on the morning of
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
the 11th, for the court ceremony of the promulgation of
the new Constitution, a man, unknown to the servants, made
summons on the big bell hung by custom at the house entrance,
and asked to see the Minister on important business.
He was told the Minister was dressing, and could see no one.
The unknown replied that he must see him about a matter
of life and death,&mdash;as indeed it was. The apparent gravity
of the object induced the servant to admit him to an ante-chamber
and report the matter. In consequence, the Minister&rsquo;s
private secretary came down to interview him. The
man, who seemed well behaved, informed the secretary that
there was a plot to take the Minister&rsquo;s life, and that he had
come to warn the Minister of it. Truly a subtle subterfuge;
true to the letter, since the plot was all his own. More he
refused to divulge except to the Minister himself. While the
secretary was trying to learn something more definite, Mori
came down stairs, and entered the room. The unknown approached
to speak to him; then, suddenly drawing a knife
from his girdle, sprang at him, and crying &lsquo;This for
desecrating the shrines of Ise!&rsquo; stabbed him twice in the
stomach. Mori, taken by surprise, grappled with him, when
one of his body guards, hearing the noise, rushed in, and
with one blow of his sword almost completely severed the
man&rsquo;s head from his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, Mori had fallen to the floor, bleeding fast.
The secretary, with the help of the guard, raised him, carried
him to his room, and despatched a messenger for the court
surgeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The clothes of the unknown were then searched for some
clue to the mystery; for neither Mori nor any of his household
had ever seen him before. The search proved more
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
than successful. A paper was found on his person, setting
forth in a most circumstantial manner the whole history
of his crime, from its inception to its execution, or his own.
However reticent he seemed before the deed, he evidently
meant nothing should be hid after it, whether he succeeded
or not. The paper explained the reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, it read, of the act of sacrilege committed by Mori
Arinori, who, on a visit to the shrines of Ise, two years before,
had desecrated the temple by pushing its curtain back with
his cane, and had defiled its floor by treading upon it with
his boots, he, Nishino Buntaro, had resolved to kill Mori,
and avenge the insult offered to the gods and to the Emperor,
whose ancestors they were. To wipe the stain from
the national faith and honor, he was ready to lose his life,
if necessary. He left this paper as a memorial of his intent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime the messenger sent for the court surgeon
failed to find him, for he was at the palace. The same was
true of the next in rank, and when at last a surgeon was
found Mori had lost so much blood that in the night of the
following day he died.</p>
<p>Both by his opinions and his tactless conduct as a minister
Mori had made himself unpopular and rumors that
his life was in danger had been current for two or three days.
&ldquo;If Mori was thus a very definite sort of person, Nishino was
quite as definite in his own way.&rdquo; At the time of his crime
he held a post in the Home Department, where he brooded
over the insult to the gods. &ldquo;He seems to have heard of it
accidentally, but it made so much impression upon him that
he journeyed to Ise to find out the truth of the tale. He was
convinced, and forthwith laid his plans with the singleness
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
of zeal of a fanatic,&rdquo; as appears from his affectionate
farewell letters to his father and his younger brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the strangest and most significant part of the affair
was the attitude of the Japanese public toward it. The first
excitement of the news had not passed before it became evident
that their sympathy was not with the murdered man,
but with his murderer.... Nishino was an unknown....
Yet the sentiment was unmistakable. The details of the
murder were scarcely common property before the press
proceeded to eulogize the assassin. To praise the act was a
little too barefaced, not to say legally dangerous.... But
to praise the man became a journalistic epidemic....
Nishino, they said, had contrived and executed his plan
with all the old time <i>samurai</i> bravery. He had done it as a
<i>samurai</i> should have done it, and he had died as a <i>samurai</i>
should have died.... The summary action of the guard in
cutting the murderer down was severely censured. As if the
guard had not been appointed to this very end!... The
papers demanded the guard&rsquo;s arrest and trial.... Comment
of this kind was not confined to the press. Strange as
it may appear, the newspapers said what everybody thought....
There was no doubt about it. Beneath the surface of
decorous disapproval ran an undercurrent of admiration and
sympathy, in spots but ill hid. People talked in the same
strain as the journalists wrote. Some did more than talk.
The geisha, or professional singing girls of Tokyo, made of
Nishino and his heroism a veritable cult.... His grave
in the suburbs they kept wreathed with flowers. To it they
made periodic pilgrimages, and, bowing there to the gods,
prayed that a little of the hero&rsquo;s spirit might descend on
them. The practice was not a specialty of professionals.
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Persons of all ages and both sexes visited the spot in shoals,
for similar purposes. It became a mecca for a month. The
thing sounds incredible, but it was a fact. Such honor had
been paid nobody for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This in abstract is Percival&rsquo;s account of a terrible national
tragedy, and its amazing treatment by the public at large.</p>
<p>Before he had been long in Japan the old love of travel
into regions unknown to foreigners came back. He had
already visited some of the less frequented parts of the interior,
and now scanning, one evening, the map of the
country his eye was caught by the pose of a province that
stood out in graphic mystery, as he said, from the western
coast. It made a striking figure with its deep-bosomed bays
and its bold headlands. Its name was Noto; and the more
he looked the more he longed, until the desire simply carried
him off his feet. Nobody seemed to know much about
it, for scarcely a foreigner had been there; and, in fact, he
set his heart on going to Noto just because it was not known.
That is his own account of the motive for the journey he
made early in May, 1889; which turned out somewhat of a
disappointment, for the place was not, either in its physical
features or the customs of its people, very different from the
rest of Japan; but for him proved adventurous and highly
interesting. Under the title of &ldquo;Noto&rdquo; he gave an account
of it,&mdash;as usual after his return home in the following
spring,&mdash;first by a series of articles in the <i>Atlantic</i>, and then
as a book published in 1891. It is a well-told tale of a
journey, quite exciting, where he and his porters, in seeking
to scale a mountain pass, found their way lay along precipices
where the path had crumbled into the gorge below.
The descriptions of people and scenery are vigorous and
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
terse; but the book is not a philosophic study like those on
Korea and on Japanese psychology. Yet it is notable in
showing his versatility, as is also the fact that he gave the
&Phi; &Beta; &Kappa; poem at Harvard in June of that year.</p>
<p>Hurrying home to deliver that poem, shortly after his
return from Noto, he found himself busy for a year and a
half, writing, attending to his own affairs, and to business,
for he was part of the time, as Treasurer, the manager of
the Lowell Bleachery. Meanwhile his hours of leisure were
filled with a new and absorbing avocation, that of polo.</p>
<p>As a boy at Brookline, Patrick Burns, the coachman,
trained at Newcastle, had taught him to ride bareback
with a halter for a bridle&mdash;although he had never really cared
for riding, just as in college he had run races without taking
much interest in athletics. But on August 9, 1887, we find
him writing that he has bought a polo pony, and that &ldquo;Sam
Warren, Fred Stimson, et al. have just started a polo club
at Dedham, and have also in contemplation the erection of
an inn there.&rdquo; He adds that he is in both schemes; and in
fact the plan for an inn developed into a clubhouse, where
he lived in summer for some years when about Boston.
During the remainder of the first season the players knocked
the ball about&mdash;and rarely with a full team of four in a side&mdash;tried
to learn the game on a little field belonging to George
Nickerson, another member of the club. But the next year
the number increased, and Percival with his great quickness
and furious energy soon forged ahead, leading the list of
home handicaps in the club with a rating of ten, and becoming
the first captain of the team.</p>
<p>By the autumn of 1888 they had become expert enough to
play a match with the Myopia club on its grounds at Hamilton,
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
but with unfortunate results. At that time it was the
habit to open the game by having the ball thrown into the
middle of the field, and at a signal the leading player from
each side charged from his goal posts, each trying to reach
the ball first. Percival had a very fast pony, so had George
von L. Meyer on the other side, and by some misunderstanding
about the rules of turning there was a collision. In an
instant both men and both horses were flat on the field.
Percival was the most hurt, and although he mounted his
horse and tried to play, he was too much stunned to be
effective, and had to withdraw from the game.</p>
<p>In the following years he played as captain other match
games with various teams; and, in fact, the Dedham Polo
Club, which he came to regard as his home, was certainly
his chief resource for recreation and diversion in this country
until he built his Observatory in Arizona. Yet it by no
means absorbed his attention, for with all the vigor he threw
into anything he undertook he could maintain an intense
interest in several things at the same time, besides being always
ready for new ones, not least in the form of travel. So
it happened that at the end of January, 1890, he sailed again
for Europe, and with Ralph Curtis, a friend from boyhood
and a college classmate, visited Spain&mdash;not in this case to
study the people or the land, although he observed what he
saw with care, but for the pleasure and experience. Like all
good travellers he went to Seville for Holy Week and the
festivities following; but, being sensitive, the bullfight was a
thing to be seen rather than enjoyed. He had heard people
speak also of the cathedral of Burgos as marvellous, in fact
as the finest specimen in the world; so, at some inconvenience,
he went there on his way to France, and on seeing it
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
remarked that the praise bestowed upon it was due less
to its merits than to its inaccessibility. Later he noticed that
having taken the trouble to go to Burgos he never heard
anyone speak of it again. So much for people&rsquo;s estimates
of things someone else has not seen.</p>
<p>On his way home he passed through London and enjoyed
the hospitality he always found there.</p>

<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br />JAPAN AGAIN&mdash;THE SHINTO TRANCES</h2>
<p>The trip to Spain was merely an interlude; for, above all,
at this time he felt the attraction of Japan. Returning from
Europe in June he spent the summer in Dedham; but when
winter came he started again for the Far East, this time by
way of Europe, where he picked up Ralph Curtis; and then
by the Red Sea to India and Burma, reaching Tokyo about
the first of April, 1891. By far the most interesting part of
this visit to Japan arose from a journey which he took with
George Agassiz in July and August, into the interior of the
Island. Agassiz became a most devoted friend, who followed
his studies here, and later in Flagstaff, taking part in
his observations and writing a memorial after his death.
Their object was travel through a part of the mountainous
region, ending at Ontake, a high extinct volcano, one of
Japan&rsquo;s most sacred peaks. But the holiness of the spot,
or the religious pilgrimages thereto, were not the motive of
the visit; nor did they expect to see anything of that nature
with which they were not already familiar.</p>
<p>Leaving Tokyo by train on July 24, they soon reached a
point where they got off and took jinrikishas to descend later
to their own feet on a path that came &ldquo;out every now and
then over a view at spots where Agassiz said one had to be
careful not to step over into the view one&rsquo;s self.&rdquo; For the
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
next three days the lodging was not too comfortable, the
heat terrific and the footpath going over a steep mountain
pass. However, the weather improved; and without serious
misadventure they were, on August 6, ascending Ontake,
and not far from the top, when they saw three young men,
clad as pilgrims, begin a devotional ceremony. One of them
seated on a bench before a shrine, went through what looked
like contortions accompanied by a chant, while another, at
whom they were directed, sat bowed on the opposite bench
motionless until, beginning to twitch, he broke into a
paroxysm and ended by becoming stiff though still quivering.
Then the first leaned forward, and bowing down, asked
the name of the god that possessed his companion. The
other in a strange voice answered &ldquo;I am Hakkai.&rdquo; Whereat
the first asked, as of an oracle, questions that were answered;
and after the god had finished speaking, said a prayer and
woke the other from his trance. But this was not the end, for
the same thing was repeated, the three changing places by
rotation until each of them had been petitioner and entranced.
On several more occasions the ceremony was enacted
during the next thirty-six hours, the young men fasting
all that time. The whole scene is more fully described in the
opening chapter of Percival&rsquo;s &ldquo;Occult Japan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his temperament and literary ambition he thought
at once of writing about this extraordinary sight, which he
connected as a phenomenon with the fox possession he had
already encountered on a lower plane. He suggested the
title &ldquo;Ontake, a Pilgrimage,&rdquo; but he soon saw the whole
matter on a larger scale. The cult seemed to be unknown
beyond its votaries, nothing did he find written upon it,
the few foreigners who had scaled the mountain had missed
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
it altogether, although, as he says, their guides or porters
must have been familiar with it. Dr. Sturgis Bigelow, who
was a student and believer in Buddhism, had never heard
of it, which seemed strange, for although a Shinto, not a
Buddhist, rite many people accepted both faiths, and one
Buddhist sect practiced something akin to it. Moreover, its
underlying idea of possession by another spirit appeared to
ramify, not only into fox possession, but in many other
directions. On inquiry he found that there was an establishment
of the Ontake cult in Tokyo, and the head of it the
Kwanch&#333;, or primate of that Shinto sect. This man proved
very friendly and gave all the information about its rites,
their significance and underlying philosophy, within his
knowledge,&mdash;perhaps beyond it,&mdash;and arranged exhibits;
all of which Percival carefully recorded in his notebooks.
Every motion made in inducing the trance, every implement
used in the ceremony, had its meaning and its function,
which he strove to learn. Moreover, there were miracles of
splashing with boiling water, walking over hot coals and up
ladders with sword blades for rungs; curing disease; consulting
the fox and the raccoon-faced dog, which he called
Japanese table turning; and other less dignified performances
more or less connected with the idea of divine or demonic
possession. Some of these things he was able to witness by
s&eacute;ances in his own house, others by visits to the places where
they were performed, often for his special benefit.</p>
<p>All this took more time than he had expected to spend
in Japan, and delayed his sailing until the autumn was
more than half over. Nor was this enough to complete his
researches. In December of the following year he re-crossed
the Pacific, and at Christmas we find him at Yokohama.
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
Again he hires a house, fits it up in Japanese style but with
occidental furniture; again he was travelling over the land,
this time in search less of scenery than of psychic phenomena
and the lore connected with their celebration.
In July he is interviewing a Ryobu Shinto priest and &ldquo;eliciting
much valuable information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the trances, and the various miracles, a participant
must be prepared by a process of purification, long continued
for the former, always by bathing before the ceremony;
and by Percival&rsquo;s frequent attendance, and great interest,
he attained the repute for a degree of purity that
enabled him to go where others were not admitted. On
this ground he attended what he called the Kwanch&#333;&rsquo;s
Kindergarten, but was not allowed to bring a friend. The
Kwanch&#333;, as the head of the principal Shinto sect that
practised trances, had a class of boys and girls who went
through a preparation therefor by a series of what an unbeliever
might call ecstatic acrobatic feats, lasting a long
time before they were fitted for subjects of divine possession.
He visited everything relating to the mysteries that he could
find, procured from the Kwanch&#333; an introduction that enabled
him to see the interior grounds of the great shrines of
Ise, from which even the pilgrims were excluded, and to see
there a building whereof he learned the history and meaning
that the very guardian priests did not understand. At trances
he was allowed to examine the possessed, take their pulse,
and even to stick pins into them to test their sensibility,
sometimes in a way that they were far from not feeling
afterwards. In short he was enabled as no one had ever been
before, to make a very thorough examination of the phenomena
with the object of discovering and revealing their
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
significance; for he was convinced that they were perfectly
genuine, without a tinge of fraud, and allied to the hypnotism
then at the height of its vogue. In March, 1893 he
gave the first of a series of papers on Esoteric Shintoism
before the Asiatic Society of Japan. These he worked up
after his return to America in the autumn, and published
in 1895 with the title &ldquo;Occult Japan or the Way of the
Gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A casual reader might be misled by occasional cleverness
of expression into thinking the book less serious than it is.
Perhaps that accounts in part for Lafcadio Hearn&rsquo;s calling
it supercilious. Percival himself says, in the first paragraph
of the chapter on Miracles: &ldquo;It is quite possible to see the
comic side of things without losing sight of their serious
aspect. In fact, not to see both sides is to get but a superficial
view of life, missing its substance. So much for the people.
As for the priests, it is only necessary to say that few are
more essentially sincere and lovable than the Shint&#333; ones;
and few religions in a sense more true. With this preface
for life-preserver I plunge boldly into the miracles.&rdquo; In
fact, expressions that appear less serious than the subject
merits are few, and the descriptions, of the trances for example,
are almost strangely appreciative, and for a scientific
study keenly sympathetic and beautiful.</p>
<p>The book opens with an account of the trances of the
three young men on Mount Ontake, for that sight was the
source of all these researches. He next lays a foundation for
the study of the subject by a short history of the Japanese religions;
how Shinto, the old cult, with its myriad divinities
and simple rites, was for a time overshadowed by Buddhism,
to be restored with the power of the Mikado; and how with
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
its revival the popularity of the trances returned. They had
been kept alive by a single Buddhist sect which had adopted
them, but now they are even more widely practised by two
out of the ten Shinto sects, their sacred site being Ontake.
But before taking up the trances he describes the lesser, and
better known, cases of miraculous intervention for protection
from injury and for sanctification; notably, being sprinkled
with boiling water, walking over a bed of hot coals, and up
and down a ladder of sword blades; and he discusses why
no injury occurs. The walking over hot coals, at least, was
even performed in his own garden; and, although he does
not say so in the book, he did it himself, without, however,
complete immunity to the soles of his feet.</p>
<p>After telling of what he terms objective, as distinguished
from subjective, miracles, such as bringing down fire from
heaven; and saying something of miraculous healing of
disease, he comes to the main subject of the book, the incarnations
or trances. First he speaks of the preparation for
them, washing and fasting which are arduous and long, the
purification of persons and places, and a series of ceremonies
which, he says, tend to promote vacuity of mind. All these
things are absolutely sincere, for he declares that the first
view of a trance dispels any idea of sham. He then describes
three typical trances: first Ryobu, a Shinto-Buddhist sect,
where one of the men possessed, on coming back to himself,
was disappointed that he had not spoken English, which he
did not know himself; for to his mind it was not he that
spoke but the god who entered into him. The second example
was a Buddhist trance with the full complement of
eight persons filling their several offices in the ceremony.
This description is especially striking and sympathetic. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
third case is of a pure Shinto trance, much the same, but with
the simpler ceremonial of that cult. He describes also the
Kwanch&#333;&rsquo;s training school, which has already been referred
to as the Kindergarten. He notes the pulse, insensibility, the
other physical conditions and sensations of the possessed, the
sex and number of the gods who enter him, for the exorcist
has no power to invoke the spirit he would prefer, but simply
calls for a god, and when one comes inquires who it is. It
may be a god or a goddess, and several of them may come in
succession. The main object of the proceeding being to obtain
counsel or prophecy, the exorcist, and he alone, can ask
questions of him, but he can do so on behalf of anyone
else, and often did so for Percival about his own affairs, although
the prophecies appear never to have turned out
right.</p>
<p>A chapter is devoted to pilgrimages and the pilgrim clubs,
which included in the aggregate vast numbers of people,
only a minute part of whom, however, belonged to the
trance sects. They subscribed small sums to be used to send
each year a few of their members to the shrine or sacred
mountain with which the club is associated; this feature of
the religious organization being as important from a social
as a religious point of view. Another chapter is given to the
Gohei, or sacred cluster of paper strips, used for all spiritual
purposes, and essential in calling down any god; an emblem
which he compares with the crucifix, while pointing out the
difference in their use. This first part of the book ends with
an argument, apparently to one who knows nothing about
the matter conclusive, that the whole subject of these trances
is of Shinto not Buddhist origin; and in this connection he
tells of his visit to the shrines of Ise where a temple was built
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
to the sun-goddess when she possessed people, as she has
long ceased to do at these shrines.</p>
<p>So far the book is scientific; that is, it consists of a description
and analysis of phenomena repeatedly observed and
carefully tested. The second part, which he calls Noumena,
is an explanation of them on general psychological principles,
and thus belongs rather to philosophy than science. It comprises
discussions of the essence of self, of the freedom of the
will, of the motive forces of ideas, of individuality, of
dreams, hypnotism and trances. In these matters he was
much influenced by the recently published &ldquo;Psychology&rdquo; of
William James, which he had with him, and he draws comparisons
with hypnotism, a more prominent subject then
than it is now. Bearing in mind his dominant thought about
the essential quality of the Japanese, it is not unnatural that
he should find in the greater frequency of such phenomena
among them than elsewhere a confirmation of his theory
of their comparative lack of personality.</p>
<p>Perhaps his own estimate of the relative value of the two
parts of the book and that of critics might not agree; but,
however that may be, the second part is penetrating, and the
work as a whole a remarkable study of a subject up to that
time practically wholly concealed from the many observers
of Japanese life and customs. It was, in fact, his farewell to
Japan, for, leaving in the fall of 1893, he never again visited
that land. Ten years its people had been his chief intellectual
interest, but perhaps he thought he had exhausted the vein
in which he had been at work, or another interest may have
dislodged it. He has left no statement of why he gave up
Japan for astronomy, but probably there is truth in both of
these conjectures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Talking later to George Agassiz, Percival attributed the
change to the fact that Schiaparelli, who had first observed
the fine lines on the planet Mars which he called &ldquo;canali,&rdquo;
found that his failing eyesight prevented his pursuing his
observations farther, and that he had determined to carry
them on. That may well have directed his attention to the
particular planet; but the interest in astronomy lay far
deeper, extending back to the little telescope of boyhood
on the roof of his father&rsquo;s house at Brookline. We have
seen that his Commencement Part at graduation was on the
nebular hypothesis, and he never lost his early love of such
things. In July, 1891, he writes to his brother-in-law, William
L. Putnam, about a project for writing on what he calls
the philosophy of the cosmos, with illustrations from
celestial mechanics. That was just before he went to Ontake
and there became involved in the study of trances, &ldquo;which,&rdquo;
as he says in his next letter to the same, &ldquo;adds another to
my budget of literary eventualities.&rdquo; In fact, the trances
occupied most of his time for the next two years, without
banishing the thought of later taking up other things, or effacing
the lure of astronomy, for in 1892 he took with him
to Japan a six-inch telescope, no small encumbrance unless
really desired, and he writes of observing Saturn therewith.
Whatever may have been the reason, it seems probable from
the rapidity with which he threw himself into astronomy
and into its planetary branch, that at least he had something
of the kind in his mind before he returned from Japan in
the autumn of 1893.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br />THE OBSERVATORY AT FLAGSTAFF</h2>
<p>When, returning from Japan late in 1893, Percival Lowell
found himself quickly absorbed by astronomical research,
he was by no means without immediate equipment for the
task. His mathematical capacity, that in college had so impressed
Professor Benjamin Peirce, had not been allowed to
rust away; for, when at home, he had kept it bright in the
Mathematical and Physical (commonly called the M. P.)
Club, a group of men interested in the subject, mainly from
Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. So fresh was it that we find him using, at the
outset, with apparent ease his calculus&mdash;both differential and
integral&mdash;tools that have a habit of losing edge with disuse.
Physically, also, he had a qualification of great importance
for the special work he was to undertake,&mdash;that of perceiving
on the disks of the planets, very fine markings close to
the limit of visibility; for the late Dr. Hasket Derby, then
the leading practitioner in Ophthalmology in Boston, told
Professor Julian Coolidge that Percival&rsquo;s eyesight was the
keenest he had ever examined.</p>
<p>One essential remained, to find the best atmosphere for
his purpose. In entering our air the rays of light from the
stars are deflected, that is bent, and bent again when they
strike a denser or less dense stratum. But these strata are
continually changing with currents of warmer or colder
air rising and falling above the surface of the earth, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
hence the rays of light are being shifted a little from side to
side as they reach us. Everyone is familiar with the twinkling
of the stars, caused in this way; for before entering our
atmosphere their light is perfectly steady. Moreover, everyone
must have observed that the amount of twinkling varies
greatly. At times it is unusually intense, and at others the
stars seem wonderfully still. Now, although the planets,
being near enough to show a disk visible through a telescope,
do not seem to twinkle, the same thing in fact occurs. The
light is deflected, and the shaking makes it very difficult to
see the smaller markings. Imagine trying to make out the
detail on an elaborately decorated plate held up by a man
with a palsied hand. The plate would be seen easily, but
for the detail one would wish it held in a steadier grasp, and
for observing the planets this corresponds to a steadier atmosphere.</p>
<p>Percival&rsquo;s own account of the reason for his expedition of
1894 to observe the planet Mars, why he selected Flagstaff
as the site, what he did there and how the plan developed
into the permanent observatory that bears his name were
told in what was intended to be an introduction to the first
volume of the Annals of the Observatory. Perhaps owing
to the author&rsquo;s illness in the last years of the century this
statement was mislaid and was not found until February 22,
1901. It is here printed in full.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Annals of the Lowell Observatory</span>
<br /><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h3>
<p>In the summer of 1877 occurred an event which was to
mark a new departure in astronomy,&mdash;the detection by Schiaparelli
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
of the so-called canals of the planet Mars. The detection
of these markings has led to the turning over of an
entirely new page in cosmogony.</p>
<p>Schiaparelli&rsquo;s discovery shared the fate of all important
astronomical advances,&mdash;even Newton&rsquo;s theory of gravitation
was duly combatted in its day,&mdash;it, and still more the possibilities
with which it was fraught, distanced the comprehension
of its time. In consequence, partly from general
disbelief, partly from special difficulty, no notable addition
was made to Schiaparelli&rsquo;s own work until 1892, when
Professor W. H. Pickering attacked the planet at the Boyden
Station of the Harvard Observatory at Arequipa, Peru, and
made the next addition to our knowledge of our neighbor
world.</p>
<p>Intrinsically important as was Pickering&rsquo;s work, it was
even more important extrinsically. Schiaparelli&rsquo;s discoveries
were due solely to the genius of the man,&mdash;his insight, not
his eyesight, for at the telescope eyes differ surprisingly
little, brains surprisingly much; Pickering&rsquo;s brought into
co&ouml;peration a practically new instrument, the air itself. For
at the same time with his specific advance came a general
one,&mdash;the realization of the supreme importance of atmosphere
in astronomical research. To the Harvard Observatory
is due the first really far-reaching move in this direction, and
to Professor W. H. Pickering of that observatory the first
fruits in carrying it out.</p>
<p>It was at this stage in our knowledge of the possibilities
in planetary work and of the means to that end, in the
winter of 1893-94, that the writer determined to make an
expedition which included the putting up of an observatory
for the primary purpose of studying, under the best procurable
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
conditions, the planet Mars at his then coming opposition,&mdash;an
opposition at which the planet, though not
quite so close to us as in 1892, would be better placed for
northern observers. In this expedition he associated with
himself Prof. W. H. Pickering and Mr. A. E. Douglass.</p>
<p>The writer had two objects in view:</p>
<p>1st, the determination of the physical condition of the
planets of our solar system, primarily Mars;</p>
<p>2d, the determination of the conditions conducive to the
best astronomical observations.</p>
<p>How vital was the inter-connection of the two was demonstrated
by the results.</p>
<p>Important as atmosphere is to any astronomical investigation,
it is all-important to the study of the planets. To get,
therefore, within the limits of the United States&mdash;limits at
the time for several reasons advisable&mdash;as steady air as possible,
Prof. W. H. Pickering, who had already had experience
of Southern California as well as of Arequipa, Peru, proposed
Arizona as the most promising spot. Accordingly,
Mr. A. E. Douglass left Boston in March, 1894, with a six-inch
Clark refractor belonging to the writer, to make a test of the
seeing throughout the Territory. From his report, Flagstaff
was selected for the observatory site.</p>
<p>Flagstaff, then a town of eight hundred inhabitants, lies
on the line of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, in the centre
of the great plateau of northern Arizona, half way across
the Territory from east to west, and two fifths way down
from north to south. This plateau, whose mean elevation
is between 6000 and 7000 feet, is a great pine oasis a hundred
miles or more in diameter, rising some 3000 feet from out
the Arizona desert. It culminates in the mass known as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
San Francisco Peaks, ten miles north of Flagstaff, whose
highest summit rises 12,872 feet above the level of the sea.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The spot chosen was the eastern edge of the mesa (table-land)
to the west of Flagstaff. The site lay open to the east
and south, and was shielded on the north by the San Francisco
Peaks. The distance from the observatory to Mt.
Agassiz, the most conspicuous of the Peaks from the Flagstaff
side, was about eight miles and three fifths in an air-line,
and the distance to the town about a mile and a quarter.
As soon as the site was selected, the town very kindly deeded
to the observatory a piece of land and built a road up to
it.</p>
<p>The observatory stood 350 feet above the town, and 7250
feet above the level of the sea, in latitude 35&deg; 11&prime; north and
longitude 111&deg; 40&prime; west.</p>
<p>Prof. W. H. Pickering, to whose skill and ability was
chiefly due the successful setting up of the observatory, suggested
arrangements with Brashear for the use of an
eighteen-inch refractor which Brashear had recently constructed,&mdash;the
largest glass to be had at the time,&mdash;arrangements
which were accordingly made. He then devised
and superintended the construction of a dome intended to
be of a temporary character, which worked admirably. The
upper part of it was made in sections in Cambridgeport,
Mass., and then shipped West, the lower part being constructed
according to his specifications on the spot, under the
superintendence of Mr. Douglass.</p>
<p>The telescope was supported on one of the Clark mountings.
The bed-plate, clock-work, and a twelve-inch telescope
were leased of the Harvard College Observatory, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
mounting then altered by Alvan Clark &amp; Sons to carry both
the twelve and the eighteen-inch telescopes.</p>
<p>Six weeks from the time ground was broken, on April 23,
1894, regular observations with the eighteen-inch were begun.</p>
<p>The results of the year&rsquo;s work surpassed anticipation.
Details invisible at the average observatory were presented
at times with copper-plate distinctness, and, what is as vital,
the markings were seen hour after hour, day after day, month
after month. First sight; then system; and the one of these
factors was as fundamental to the results as the other. Systematic
work, first made possible and then properly performed,
was the open sesame to that most difficult branch
of astronomical observations, the study of our nearest neighbors
in the universe.</p>
<p>The chief results obtained were:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st, the detection of the physical characteristics of the
planet Mars to a degree of completeness sufficient to permit
of the forming of a general theory of its condition, revealing
beyond reasonable doubt first its general habitability,
and second its particular habitation at the present moment
by some form of local intelligence;</p>
<p>2d, corroboration and extension by Professor Pickering of
his discoveries at Arequipa with regard to the forms of
Jupiter&rsquo;s Satellites;<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></p>
<p>3d, the discovery and study by Mr. Douglass of the atmospheric
causes upon which good seeing depends.</p>
<p>It is of the observations connected with the first of these
that the present volume of the Annals alone treats.</p>
<p>As the publication of this volume has been so long delayed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
it seems fitting to add here a brief continuation of the history
of the observatory to the present time.</p>
<p>The results of the expedition in 1894, in the detection of
planetary detail, turned out to be so important an advance
upon what had previously been accomplished that the writer
decided to form of the temporary expedition a permanent
observatory. Accordingly, he had Alvan Clark &amp; Sons make
him a twenty-four-inch refractor, which fate decided should
be their last large glass; the Yerkes glass, although not yet in
operation at the time this goes to press, having been finished
at nearly the time his was begun. The glass received from
Mantois happened to be singularly flawless and its working
the same. It was made twenty-four inches in clear aperture,
and of a focal length of thirty-one feet. Alvan G. Clark
accompanied the writer to Flagstaff and put the glass in
place himself.</p>
<p>The mounting for the telescope was likewise made by the
Clarks. Rigidity was the prime essential, in order to secure
as stable an image as possible, and this has been admirably
carried out, the mounting being the heaviest and most stable
for a glass of its size yet made.</p>
<p>In July, 1896, Dr. T. J. J. See joined the observatory, to
continue there the line of research for which he was already
well known&mdash;the study of the double stars. This added to
the two initial objects of the observatory a third,&mdash;</p>
<p>3d, the study of double-star systems, including a complete
catalogue of those in the southern heavens.</p>
<p>During the summer and autumn of 1896 the importance
of good atmosphere was further demonstrated in an interesting
and somewhat surprising quarter. The air by day
was found to be as practicable as that by night. While Mars
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
was being studied by night, the study of Venus and Mercury
was taken up during the daytime systematically, and the
results proved as significant as had been those on Mars. Instead
of the vague diffused patches hitherto commonly
recorded, both planets&rsquo; surfaces turned out to be diversified
by markings of so distinct a character as not only to disclose
their rotation periods but to furnish the fundamental facts
of the physical conditions of their surfaces. We know now
more about Mercury and Venus than we previously knew
of Mars.</p>
<p>As the winter in Flagstaff is not so good as the summer,
it was thought well to try Mexico during that season of the
year. Accordingly, a new dome was made; the telescope was
taken down; and dome, mounting, and glasses were carried
to Mexico and set up for the winter at Tacubaya, a
suburb of the City of Mexico, at an elevation of 7500 feet.
There the observatory received every kindness at the hands
of the President, the Government, and the National Observatory.</p>
<p>Observations at Mexico fully corroborated those at Flagstaff
with regard to both Mars, Mercury and Venus, and
enabled Mr. Douglass to make the first full determination
of the markings on Jupiter&rsquo;s third and fourth satellites, thus
fixing their rotation periods.</p>
<p>Dr. See in the mean time, who while at Flagstaff had discovered
a very large number of new doubles, in Mexico
added to his list;...</p>
<p>With the spring the observatory was shipped back again
to Flagstaff.</p>
<p>Of the particular results in planetary work obtained, several
papers have been published in various astronomical
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
journals, while of them subsequent volumes of the Annals
will speak in detail. In the meantime two general conclusions
to which they have led the writer may, as possessing
future interest, fittingly be mentioned here:</p>
<p>1st, that the physical condition of the various members
of our solar system appears to be such as evolution from
a primal nebula would demand;</p>
<p>2d, that what we call life is an inevitable detail of cosmic
evolution, as inherent a property of matter from an eventual
standpoint as gravitation itself is from an instant one: as a
primal nebula or meteoric swarm, actuated by purely natural
laws, evolves a system of bodies, so each body under the same
laws, conditioned only by size and position, inevitably
evolves upon itself organic forms.</p>
<p>The reasons for the first of these conclusions have sprung
directly from the writer&rsquo;s study of the several members of
our own solar system; his reason for the second, upon the
further facts,&mdash;</p>
<p>1st, that where the physical conditions upon these bodies
point to the apparent possibility of life, we find apparent
signs of life;</p>
<p>2d, where they do not, we find none.</p>
<p>This implies that, however much its detail may vary, life is
essentially the same everywhere, since we can reason apparently
correctly as to its presence or absence, a result which
is in striking accord with the spectroscopic evidence of a practical
identity of material.</p>
<hr />
<p>Evidently the expedition to observe Mars was undertaken
quite suddenly, but if it was to be made at all it must be done
quickly. Anyone, however unfamiliar with astronomy, will
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
perceive that two planets revolving about the sun in independent
orbits will be nearest together when they are on the
same side of the sun and farthest apart when on opposite
sides of it, and that the difference is especially great if, as in
the case of the earth and Mars, their orbits are not far apart,
for when on the same side the separation is only the difference
of their distances from the sun, and when on opposite sides
it is the sum of those distances. Moreover, Mars being outside
of the Earth its whole face is seen in the full light of
the sun when both bodies are on the same side of it. Now
such a condition, called opposition, was to occur in the
summer after Percival&rsquo;s return from Japan, and therefore
there was no time to spare in getting an observatory ready
for use.</p>
<p>From the experience of others elsewhere, Percival was convinced
that the most favorable atmospheric situations would
lie in one of the two desert bands that encircle a great part
of the Earth, north and south of the equator, caused by the
sucking up of moisture by the trade winds; and that a
mountain, with the currents of air running up and down it,
did not offer so steady an atmosphere as a high table-land.
The height is important because the amount of atmosphere
through which the light travels is much less than at sea
level. He was aware that the best position of this kind
might well be found in some foreign country; but again
there was no time to search for it, or indeed to build an observatory
far away, if it must be equipped by the early summer.
The fairly dry and high plateau of northern Arizona
seemed, therefore, to offer the best chance of a favorable
site for this immediate and temporary expedition.</p>
<p>With the aid of suggestions by Professor William H.
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
Pickering, who knew what was needed in observing Mars,
he sent Mr. Douglass, with the six-inch telescope brought
back from Japan, to Arizona to inspect the astronomic steadiness
of the atmosphere. The instructions, apparently drawn
up by Professor Pickering, were dated February 28th, directing
him to observe on two nights each at Tombstone,
Tucson and Phoenix; and Percival, keeping in constant
touch with Mr. Douglass by letter and telegraph, added
among other places Flagstaff. This was shortly followed by
instructions about constructing the circular vertical part of
the dome for the observatory by local contract as soon as the
site was selected, while the spherical part above, which was
to be of parallel arches covered with wire netting and canvas,
was being made in the East and to be shipped shortly.
Meanwhile the pier was being built by Alvan Clark &amp; Sons
(who had made most of the large telescopes in this country)
and the mounting for both the eighteen-inch and the twelve-inch
telescope thereon, balancing each other. Mr. Douglass
was to report constantly; and in April Percival wrote him to
take a photograph of the site of the observatory &ldquo;now,&rdquo; then
every day as the work progressed, and have the negatives
developed, a blue print made of each as speedily as possible
and sent East. All this is stated here to show the speed,
and at the same time the careful thought, with which the
work was done. Percival and his colleagues came as near
as possible to carrying out the principle, &ldquo;when you have
made up your mind that a thing must be done, and done
quickly, do it yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact Percival did not select any of the three places first
examined, but on consideration of Mr. Douglass&rsquo; reports
preferred Flagstaff; and his choice has been abundantly confirmed
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
by the pioneering problems undertaken there, and
by the fact that this site was retained for the later permanent
Observatory. Everyone, indeed, deserves much credit for
the rapid work done at such a distance from principals busy
with the preparation of the instruments. It was characteristic
of Percival that he got the very best out of those who
worked with and under him.</p>
<p>Although the closest point of the opposition did not occur
until the autumn, the two planets, travelling in the same
direction, were near enough together for fair observation
some months earlier; and on May 28th, arriving at Flagstaff,
Percival writes to his mother: &ldquo;Here on the day. Telescope
ready for use tonight for its Arizonian virgin view....
After lunch all to the observatory where carpenters were
giving their finishing touches.... Today has been cloudy
but now shows signs of a beautiful night and so, not to bed,
but to post and then to gaze.&rdquo; The sky was not clear that
night, for an unprecedented rain came and lasted several
days, falling through the still uncanvased dome on Professor
Pickering and Percival, who had been lured by a &ldquo;fairing&rdquo;
sky into camping out there in the evening to be on time for
the early rising Mars. But it was not long before the weather
cleared and the strenuous work began. As the observatory
was a mile and a half from the hotel in the town, and uphill,
it was uncomfortable to arrive there at three o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, the hour when at that season Mars came in
sight. So in the summer a cottage was built hard by the
dome, where they could sleep and get their meals.</p>
<p>The observations were, of course, continuous throughout
the rest of the year; and except for two trips East on business,
one for a few weeks at the end of June, another in September,
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
and a few days in Los Angeles, Percival was there all
the time. As usual he worked furiously; for beside observing
most of the night he spent much of the day writing reports
and papers, making drawings for publication in scientific
and other periodicals, and investigating collateral questions
that bore upon their significance; and while he had computers
for mechanical detail, he and his colleagues had to
prepare and supervise their work. To his mother he wrote,
as a rule, every day; and in some of these letters he gave an
account of his time. On September 2nd, he writes of being
up the greater part of the night, and naturally perpetually
sleepy. &ldquo;But the number of canals increases encouragingly&mdash;in
the Lake of the Sun region we have seen nearly all
Schiaparelli&rsquo;s and about as many more.&rdquo; On October 10th:
&ldquo;Observed the better part of last night, after being welcomed
by everybody&mdash;and have been as a busy as a beaver today,
writing an article, drawing for ditto etc, etc.&rdquo;; and, two
days later, &ldquo;Chock full of work; scrabbling each day for the
post&mdash;proof etc. Mr. Douglass is now on the hill observing
Mercury. We all dine there at seven. Then I take Mars and
at 3 <span class="small">A.M.</span> Professor Pickering, Jupiter. So you see none of the
planets are neglected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one of these letters he encloses a clipping from a San
Francisco newspaper satirizing Professor Holden for saying
that the canals of Mars reported at Flagstaff were not confirmed
by observations at Mount Hamilton. Denial or doubt
that he had really seen what&mdash;after many observations confirmed
by those of his colleagues&mdash;he reported as seen always
vexed Percival, and naturally so. Yet they were not uncommon
and sometimes attributed to defective vision. He was
well aware that while a belief that a thing exists may make
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
one think he has seen it when he has not, yet it is also true
that one person perfectly familiar with an object sought will
find it when another, unacquainted with its precise appearance,
will miss it altogether. Everyone knows that people in
the habit of looking for four-leaved clovers are constantly
picking them while others never see them; or that a skilled
archaeologist finds arrowheads with much greater facility
than a tyro, who will, however, improve rapidly with a little
experience; and all this is especially true of things near the
very limit of visibility. Gradually more and more observers
began to see the finer markings and the canals on Mars, until
finally the question of their existence was set at rest when
it became possible to photograph them.</p>
<p>But in spite of work and vexation the life was far from
dull, for the observatory was as hospitable as its limited
quarters would allow. Visitors were attracted by its growing
reputation, and on August 25th he writes: &ldquo;Just as we were
plodding up there last evening in the dark we heard a carriage-full
of folk coming down. We suspected what they had
been after and were not surprised when they challenged us
with &lsquo;Are you observatory people?&rsquo; It seems they were, as
they informed us pathetically, people from the East and
had gone up to look through the glass, if they might, before
taking the train at 12.30 that night. Of course we could not
resist their appeals and so, though we had thought to turn
in betimes because of early observations in the morning,
entertained these angels&mdash;half of them were women&mdash;on
&lsquo;just like diamonds&rsquo; as they said of the stars. The out-of-focus
views pleased them the most&mdash;as turns out to be the
case generally. This morning when I went to take Pickering&rsquo;s
place I found another angel in the shape of a Colorado
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
man, out here for his health, in the dome with Pickering&mdash;a
nice fellow he turned out. It was then 4 h. 8 m. o&rsquo;clock in
the morning,&mdash;a matutinal hour for a man to trudge a mile
and a half on no breakfast up to an observatory on a hill&mdash;That
shows real astronomical interest. He was rewarded
gastronomically with some coffee of my brewing, all three
of us breakfasting standing by the platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were occasional picnics and trips to the cave dwellings,
the Grand Ca&ntilde;on, the petrified forest and other sights.
Moreover, Percival greatly enjoyed the scenery about Flagstaff,
and took an interest in the people of the town, although
well aware of inexperience in some matters. On
October 13th he says: &ldquo;There was a grand republican rally
last night and the young Flagstaff band that is learning to
play in tune serenaded the speaker of the occasion under the
hotel windows in fine style. When you knew the air beforehand
you could follow it with enthusiasm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br />MARS</h2>
<p>Meanwhile the work of the Observatory went on, partly
in the direction of the special lines of the several observers,
but mainly in that of the founder whose interest was then
predominantly planetary, especially in Mars; and from this
the site of the dome came to be called Mars Hill. The clear
atmosphere yielded the results that had been hoped for, and
much was discovered about the planets, their period of rotation,
satellites etc., but above all were the Martian observations
fruitful. There the object was to watch the seasonal
changes beginning with the vernal equinox, or spring of
the southern hemisphere, the one inclined toward the earth
when the two bodies approach most closely, and follow
them through the summer and autumn of our neighbor.
For those not familiar with the topography of Mars it may
be said that the greater part of its surface is a reddish or
orange color interspersed with patches or broken bands of a
blue, or greenish blue, in the southern temperate zone.
These had been supposed to be seas, and are still known by
names recalling that opinion, while the lighter regions derived
their nomenclature from the theory that they are continents
or islands standing out of the water. This is confusing,
but must be borne in mind by anyone who looks at a map
of the planet and tries to understand the meaning of the
terms. There are several reasons for thinking that the dark
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
areas are not seas: one that they change in depth of color
with the seasons; another that light reflected from water is
polarized and in this case it is not; also they never show a
brilliant specular reflection of the Sun as seas would do.</p>
<p>Now in the winter of the Martian southern hemisphere the
region around that pole turned white, that is it became
covered by a mantle appearing like snow or ice, and as the
summer advanced this became less and less until it disappeared
altogether. Meanwhile there formed around it a dark
mass that spread downwards, toward the temperate zone and
into the bluish areas there, which assumed a darker hue. After
the deepening color had reached the edge of the wrongly
called sea, very thin straight lines appeared proceeding from
it into the lighter reddish regions (mistaken for continents)
toward the equator, and increased rapidly in number until
there was a great network of them. It very often happened
that more than two of these intersected at the same point,
and when that occurred there usually came a distinct dot
much larger than the thickness of the lines themselves. After
this process was fairly under way the dark areas faded down
again, and then similar fine lines appeared in them, connecting
with those in the light areas, and apparently continuing
toward the pole. Moreover, some of the lines in the light
region doubled, that is two parallel lines appeared usually
running in this case not to the centres, but to the two sides
of the dark dots. It is essential to add that the limit of thickness
for any line on Mars to be seen by their telescopes was
estimated at about fifteen miles, so that these fine lines must
have been at least of that width.</p>
<p>Such is in brief the outline of that which the observers saw.
What did these things mean? What was the interpretation
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
of the phenomena, their opinion on the causes and operation?
This, with the details of the observations, is given by Percival
in his book &ldquo;Mars,&rdquo; written immediately after this first year
of observation, the preface bearing the date November, 1895.
But it must not be supposed that he started to observe with
any preconceived idea that the planet was inhabited, or
with the object of proving that the so-called canals were the
work of intelligent beings, for in the preface to the fourth
edition he says: &ldquo;The theory contained in this book was conceived
by me toward the end of the first year&rsquo;s work at Flagstaff.
Up to that time, although the habitability of Mars
had been often suggested and strenuously opposed, no theory
based upon sufficient facts had ever been put forth that
bound the facts into a logical consistent whole&mdash;the final
rivet perhaps was when the idea of the oases occurred to me.&rdquo;
The oases were the dots at the intersection of the fine lines
which were called by Schiaparelli &ldquo;canali&rdquo; and have retained
the name canals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mars&rdquo; begins with a description of the planet, of its
orbit, size and shape, as compared with that of the Earth.
By means of its trifling satellites its mass was determined,
and from this and its dimensions the force of gravity at its
surface, which was found to be a little over one third of that
on the Earth; so that living creatures, if any, could be much
larger than those of the same type here. From the markings
that could be seen on its face the period of rotation, that is the
length of the Martian day, was measured with great accuracy,
being about forty minutes longer than our own; while the
Martian year, known from its revolution round the sun, was
about twice the length of ours. All this led to a calculation of
the nature of the planet&rsquo;s seasons, which for its southern
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
hemisphere&mdash;the one turned toward the Earth when the two
bodies are near together as in 1894&mdash;gave a long cold winter
and a summer short and hot.</p>
<p>He then takes up the question of atmosphere, which, with
water, is absolutely necessary for life, and even for physical
changes of any kind &ldquo;when once what was friable had
crumbled to pieces under the alternate roasting and refrigerating,
relatively speaking, to which the body&rsquo;s surface
would be exposed as it turned round on its axis into and out
of the sun&rsquo;s rays. Such disintegration once accomplished, the
planet would roll thenceforth a mummy world through
space,&rdquo; like our own moon, as he says, where, except for
the possible tumbling in of a crater wall, all is now deathly
still. But on Mars changes occur on a scale vast enough
to be visible from the Earth, and he tells in greater detail the
first of those noted in the preceding summary, the formation
and melting of the polar snows. Moreover, a change was observed
in the diameter of the planet, which could be explained
only by the presence of a twilight zone, and this meant an
atmosphere refracting the rays of the sun, a phenomenon
that he dwells upon at some length. He then turns to the
nature of the atmosphere, and from the relative cloudlessness
and the lesser force of gravity concludes that its density
is probably about one seventh of that on the surface of the
Earth. So much for its quantity. For its quality he considers
the kinetic theory of gases, and calculates that in spite of
its lesser gravity it could retain oxygen, nitrogen, water
vapor, and in fact all the elements of our atmosphere.</p>
<p>He next considers the question of water, the other essential
to the existence of life, animal or vegetable; the phenomenon
of the diminution, and final disappearance, of the polar
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
cap, the behavior of the dark blue band which formed along
it; and says: &ldquo;That the blue was water at the edge of the
melting snow seems unquestionable. That it was the color
of water; that it so persistently bordered the melting snow;
and that it subsequently vanished, are three facts mutually
confirmatory to this deduction. But a fourth bit of proof,
due to the ingenuity of Professor W. H. Pickering, adds its
weight to the other three. For he made the polariscope tell
the same tale. On scrutinizing the great bay through an Arago
polariscope, he found the light coming from the bay to be
polarized. Now, to polarize the light it reflects is a property,
as we know, of a smooth surface such as that of water is.&rdquo;
The great bay of which he speaks is the widest part of the
blue band. He discusses the suggestion that the white cap
is due, as had been suggested, to congealed carbonic acid gas
instead of ice or snow from water, and points out that with
the slight density of the Martian atmosphere this would require
a degree of cold impossible under the conditions of the
planet; an important conclusion later fully confirmed by
radiometric measures at Flagstaff and Mt. Wilson.</p>
<p>Assuming therefore that the polar cap is composed of snow
or ice, he traced its history, as observed more closely than
ever before at Flagstaff, and gives a map of its gradual
shrinking and final disappearance, with the corresponding
condition of the blue water at its edge. All this from June 3
to October 13 of our year, or from May 1 to July 13 of the
Martian seasons, and this was the first time the cap had been
seen to vanish wholly. It is interesting to note that in the
early morning of June 8 &ldquo;as I was watching the planet, I saw
suddenly two points like stars flash out in the midst of the
polar cap. Dazzlingly bright upon the duller white background
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
of the snow, these stars shone for a few moments
and then slowly disappeared. The seeing at the time was
very good. It is at once evident what the other-world apparitions
were,&mdash;not the fabled signal lights of Martian folk, but
the glint of ice-slopes flashing for a moment earthward as
the rotation of the planet turned the slope to the proper
angle ... nine minutes before they reach Earth they had
ceased to be on Mars, and, after their travel of one hundred
millions of miles, found to note them but one watcher, alone
on a hill-top with the dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seven years before Green, at Madeira, had seen the same
thing at the same spot on the planet, drawn the same conclusion,
and named the heights the Mitchell Mountains,
after the man who had done the like in 1846. Later the
blue belt below the cap turned brown; &ldquo;of that mud-color
land does from which the water has recently been drained
off,&rdquo; and at last, &ldquo;where the polar ice-cap and polar sea had
been was now one ochre stretch of desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The geography of Mars he describes, but what he tells
cannot be made intelligible without the twelve successive
views he gives of the planet as it turns around; while the
names of places, given in the main by Schiaparelli, are based
in large part on the mistaken impression that the dark regions
were seas and bays, the light ones continents and
islands. &ldquo;Previous to the present chart,&rdquo; Percival writes, &ldquo;the
most detailed map of the planet was Schiaparelli&rsquo;s, made
in 1888. On comparison with his, it will be seen that the
present one substantially confirms all his detail, and adds to
it about as much more. I have adopted his nomenclature,
and in the naming of the newly found features have selected
names conformable to his scheme, which commends itself
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
both on practical and on poetic grounds.&rdquo; By this, of course,
he does not mean to commend naming the dark areas as
seas, for his description of the features on the planet&rsquo;s surface
is followed by a statement of the reasons, apparently
conclusive, for assuming that the blue-green regions cannot
be seas, but must be vegetation; while the reddish ochre ones
are simply desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the melting of its polar cap, and the transference of
the water thus annually set free to go its rounds, seem to
depend all the seasonal phenomena on the surface of the
planet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The observations upon which this deduction is based extend
over a period of nearly six months, from the last day
of May to the 22d of November. They cover the regions
from the south pole to about latitude forty north. That
changes analogous to those recorded, differing, however,
in details, occur six Martian months later in the planet&rsquo;s
northern hemisphere, is proved by what Schiaparelli has
seen.&rdquo; In order that the reader may not be confused, and
wonder why the changes at the north pole do not begin
shortly after those in the southern hemisphere are over, he
must remember that the Martian year has 687 days, and is
thus nearly twice as long as ours, or in other words that
the period of these observations covered only about four
months in Mars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So soon as the melting of the snow was well under way,
long straits, of deeper tint than their surroundings, made
their appearance in the midst of the dark areas,&rdquo; although
the dark areas were then at their darkest. &ldquo;For some time the
dark areas continued largely unchanged in appearance;
that is, during the earlier and most extensive melting of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
snow-cap. After this their history became one long chronicle
of fading out. Their lighter parts grew lighter, and their
darker ones less dark. For, to start with, they were made
up of many tints; various shades of blue-green interspersed
with glints of orange-yellow.... Toward the end of October,
a strange, and, for observational purposes, a distressing
phenomenon took place. What remained of the more southern
dark regions showed a desire to vanish, so completely did
those regions proceed to fade in tint throughout.&rdquo; He points
out that such a change is inexplicable if the dark areas were
water, for there was no place for it to go to. &ldquo;But if, instead
of being due to water, the blue-green tint had been due to
leaves and grasses, just such a fading out as was observed
should have taken place as autumn came on, and that without
proportionate increase of green elsewhere; for the great
continental areas, being desert, are incapable of supporting
vegetation, and therefore of turning green.&rdquo; By the continental
areas he meant the barren regions, formerly thought
to stand out from seas in contrast with the darker ones supposed
to be water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus we see that several independent phenomena all
agree to show that the blue-green regions of Mars are not
water, but, generally at least, areas of vegetation; from
which it follows that Mars is very badly off for water, and
that the planet is dependent on the melting of its polar
snows for practically its whole supply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such scarcity of water on Mars is just what theory would
lead us to expect. Mars is a smaller planet than the Earth,
and therefore is relatively more advanced in his evolutionary
career.&rdquo; And as a planet grows old its water retreats through
cracks and caverns into its interior. The so-called seas were,
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
he thinks, once such, and &ldquo;are still the lowest portions of
the planet, and therefore stand to receive what scant water
may yet travel over the surface.&rdquo; With this agrees the fact
that the divisions between the dark and light areas run
south-east north-west; as they would if made by currents in
water flowing from the pole toward the equator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if a planet were at any stage of its career able to
support life, it is probable that a diminishing water supply
would be the beginning of the end of that life, for the air
would outlast the available water.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mars is, apparently, in this distressing plight at the present
moment, the signs being that its water supply is now exceedingly
low. If, therefore, the planet possess inhabitants,
there is but one course open to them in order to support life.
Irrigation, and upon as vast a scale as possible, must be the
all-engrossing Martian pursuit....</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this point in our inquiry, when direct deduction
from the general physical phenomena observable on the
planet&rsquo;s surface shows that, were there inhabitants there, a
system of irrigation would be an all-essential of their existence,
the telescope presents us with perhaps the most
startling discovery of modern times,&mdash;the so-called canals
of Mars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then takes up these so-called canals or lines which start
from the edge of the blue-green regions, proceed directly to
what seem centres in the middle of the ochre areas, where
they meet other lines that come, he says, &ldquo;with apparently
a like determinate intent. And this state of things is not
confined to any one part of the planet, but takes place all
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
over the reddish-ochre regions,&rdquo; that is the arid belt of the
planet. &ldquo;Plotting upon a globe betrays them to be arcs of
great circles almost invariably, even the few outstanding exceptions
seeming to be but polygonal combinations of the
same.&rdquo; These two facts, that the lines are great circles, or the
shortest distance between points on the surface of the planet,
and that several of them often meet at the same place, must
be borne in mind, because they are essential elements in his
argument that they are the result of an intelligent plan.</p>
<p>The lines are of enormous length, the shortest being 250
miles, and the longest 3,540, and at times three, four, five, and
even seven come together at one spot. By them the whole
region is cut up, and how many there may be cannot now,
he says, be determined, for the better the air at the observatory
the more of them become visible. At Flagstaff they
detected 183, seen from once to 127 times, and there were in
the aggregate 3,240 records made of them.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>In seeking for the origin of the lines he begins by discarding
natural causation on the ground first of their straightness,
and second of their uniform width, regularities not to be
found to any such a degree in the processes of nature. His
third ground is &ldquo;that the lines form a system; that, instead
of running anywhither, they join certain points to certain
others, making thus, not a simple network, but one whose
meshes connect centres directly with one another.... If
lines be drawn haphazard over the surface of a globe, the
chances are ever so many to one against more than two lines
crossing each other at any point. Simple crossings of two
lines will of course be common in something like factorial
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
proportion to the number of lines; but that any other line
should contrive to cross at the same point would be a coincidence
whose improbability only a mathematician can
properly appreciate, so very great is it.... In other words,
we might search in vain for a single instance of such encounter.
On the surface of Mars, however, instead of searching
in vain, we find the thing occurring <i>passim</i>; this <i>a priori</i>
most improbable rendezvousing proving the rule, not the
exception. Of the crossings that are best seen, all are meeting
places for more than two canals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then takes up the question of cracks radiating from
centres of explosion or fissure, and points out that such
cracks would not be of uniform breadth. There are cracks
on the moon which look like cracks, while the lines on Mars
do not. Moreover, the lines fit into one another which
would not be true of cracks radiating from different centres.
The lines cannot be rivers for those would not be the same
width throughout, or run on arcs of great circles. Nor can
the lines be furrows ploughed by meteorites, since these
would not run straight from one centre to another; in short
the objection from the infinitesimal chance of several lines
crossing at the same point applies. &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; he concludes,
&ldquo;no natural theory has yet been advanced which will explain
these lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The development, or order in the visibility, of the canals
throws light on their nature. Early in the Martian spring
they were invisible, then those nearest to the melting snows
of its south pole appeared, and in a general succession those
farther and farther away; but when they did appear they
were always in the same place where they had been seen before.
Each canal, however, did not darken all at once, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
gradually; and this he accounts for by saying that what we
see is not water but vegetation which takes time to develop.
&ldquo;If, therefore, we suppose what we call a canal to be, not the
canal proper, but the vegetation along its banks, the observed
phenomena stand accounted for. This suggestion
was first made some years ago by Professor W. H. Pickering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That what we see is not the canal proper, but the line of
land it irrigates, disposes incidentally of the difficulty of conceiving
a canal several miles wide. On the other hand, a
narrow, fertilized strip of country is what we should expect
to find; for, as we have seen, the general physical condition
of the planet leads us to the conception, not of canals constructed
for waterways,&mdash;like our Suez Canal,&mdash;but of canals
dug for irrigation purposes. We cannot, of course, be sure
that such is their character, appearances being often highly
deceitful; we can only say that, so far, the supposition best
explains what we see. Further details of their development
point to this same conclusion.&rdquo; Such as that with time they
darken rather than broaden.</p>
<p>To the objection that canals could not be built in straight
lines because of mountain ranges he replies that the surface
of Mars is surprisingly flat, and this he proves by careful
observations of the terminator, that is the edge of that part
of the planet lighted by the Sun, where any considerable
sudden changes of elevation on the surface of the planet
would appear, and do not.</p>
<p>He then tells of the discovery by Mr. Douglass of the
canals in the dark regions toward the south pole. They
could not be seen while those regions remained dark, but
when they faded out the canals became visible, and supplied
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
the missing link explaining how the water from the melting
polar cap was conveyed to the canals in the arid space north
and south of the equator. Mr. Douglass found no less than
forty-four of them, almost all of which he saw more than
once, one on as many as thirty-seven occasions.</p>
<p>Then came the phenomenon that convinced Percival of an
artificial system of irrigation: &ldquo;Dotted all over the reddish-ochre
ground of the desert stretches of the planet ... are
an innumerable number of dark circular or oval spots. They
appear, furthermore, always in intimate association with
the canals. They constitute so many hubs to which the canals
make spokes&rdquo;; and there is not a single instance of such a
spot, unconnected by a canal, and by more than one, with
the rest of the system. These spots are in general circular,
from 120 to 150 miles in diameter, and make their appearance
after, but not long after, the canals that lead to them,
those that appear first becoming after a time less conspicuous,
those seen later more so. In short they behave as oases of
vegetation would when a supply of water had reached them,
and thus give &ldquo;an end and object for the existence of canals,
and the most natural one in the world, namely, that the
canals are constructed for the express purpose of fertilizing
the oases.... This, at least, is the only explanation that
fully accounts for the facts. Of course all such evidence of
design may be purely fortuitous, with about as much probability,
as it has happily been put, as that a chance collection
of numbers should take the form of the multiplication table.&rdquo;
He does not fail to point out that great circles for the canals,
and circular shapes for the oases, are the forms most economical
if artificially constructed; nor does his reasoning rest
upon a small number of instances, for up to the close of
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
observations at that time fifty-three oases had been discovered.</p>
<p>Finally he deals with the corroborating phenomena of
double canals and the curious dark spots where the canals in
the dark regions debouch into those that run through the
deserts.</p>
<p>In his conclusion he sums up his ideas as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To review, now, the chain of reasoning by which we have
been led to regard it probable that upon the surface of Mars
we see the effects of local intelligence. We find, in the first
place, that the broad physical conditions of the planet are
not antagonistic to some form of life; secondly, that there is
an apparent dearth of water upon the planet&rsquo;s surface, and
therefore, if beings of sufficient intelligence inhabited it, they
would have to resort to irrigation to support life; thirdly,
that there turns out to be a network of markings covering
the disk precisely counterparting what a system of irrigation
would look like; and, lastly, that there is a set of spots placed
where we should expect to find the lands thus artificially
fertilized, and behaving as such constructed oases should.
All this, of course, may be a set of coincidences, signifying
nothing; but the probability points the other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the harvest of facts and ideas garnered from
Mars at the Observatory during this summer of tireless
watching. Both the facts and the conclusions drawn from
them were received with incredulity by astronomers whose
atmospheres and unfamiliarity with the things to be observed
hindered their seeing the phenomena, and to whom
the explanations seemed fantastic. With more careful observation
skepticism about the phenomena decreased, one
observer after another seeing the change of color on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
planet, the growth of vegetation, and in some form the lines
and the dots, although many skilled observers still see them
as irregular markings rather than as fine uniform lines.
The hypothesis of artificial construction of the canals by intelligent
beings has met with much more resistance. It runs
against the blade of Occam&rsquo;s razor, that nothing should be
attributed to conscious intelligent action unless it cannot be
explained by natural forces. Percival seems to have made a
very strong argument against any natural cause yet suggested,
and a rational case for an intelligent agency if no
natural one can be found. There, for the present, his hypothesis
may be said to rest.</p>
<p>The favorable period for observation during the opposition
of Mars having come to an end, the two larger telescopes,
which had been hired or borrowed for the expedition,
were returned in the spring to their owners, the observatory
at Flagstaff being dismantled, and the rest of the apparatus
brought East and stored; but plans for further work on Mars
were by no means given up; and Percival&mdash;bent on still better
equipment for the next opposition of Mars, in the summer
of 1896&mdash;arranged with Alvan Clark &amp; Sons for the
manufacture of a 24-inch refractor lens. The Clarks were
then the most successful makers of large lenses in the world;
for up to that time it had not been possible to cast and cool
these large pieces of glass so that they were perfectly uniform
in density, and the art of the Clarks consisted in grinding
and rubbing the surface so as to make its slight departure
from the calculated curves compensate for any unevenness
in density; and to a less extent it is still necessary. It required
a skill of eye and hand unequalled elsewhere, and
Percivals&rsquo; lens was one of the most perfect they ever made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Where the telescope should be set up was not yet decided;
for it will be remembered that he wanted to make his observations
in any accessible place in the world where the
clearest, and especially the steadiest, atmosphere would be
found. As already explained, he believed this lay in one of
the two great desert belts that encircle the Earth north and
south of the equator; and, for practical purposes, that meant
Arizona, Mexico and South America in the Western
Hemisphere, and the Sahara in the Eastern. Mr. Douglass
had therefore been sent&mdash;probably with the faithful 6-inch
telescope&mdash;to Mexico and South America, while Percival
proposed to examine the Sahara himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br />THE PERMANENT OBSERVATORY&mdash;INTERLUDES AND TRAVELS</h2>
<p>The year following his return to Boston, at the end of November,
1894, was filled with the arrangements for his new
telescope and apparatus, and in writing the book on Mars.
At this time he lived at 11 West Cedar Street, the little house
he had bought some time before; for it was characteristic
that, while lavishing whatever was needed on his observatory,
he was modest in his expenditure on himself. By the
end of the year his book was published, his work for the
coming observatory was done, and he went to Europe; but
his Mother had died in March, and the daily stream of loving
letters, which told about himself, had ceased to flow.</p>
<p>On December 10, 1895, he sailed on the <i>Spree</i> with Alvan
G. Clark, the last surviving brother of the telescope-making
family. The voyage, though very rough at times, was uneventful,
until as they were entering the Solent the vessel
struck, and stuck fast, on Warden&rsquo;s Ledge, just inside the
Needles. &ldquo;Fault of the pilot&rdquo; Percival recorded, &ldquo;aged 73 and
bordering on imbecility.&rdquo; With all his travels about and
around the world this is the nearest he ever came to shipwreck;
nor was it for him very near, for since the ship could
not get herself clear tugs came down the next day and took
off the passengers, who were landed at Southampton and
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
went up to London. Two days later he was in Paris, and
for nearly three weeks he and Clark saw astronomical
friends,&mdash;among others having to lunch and dinner Edouard
Mantois, the great glass manufacturer who had cast the new
24-inch refractor for his telescope. Percival enjoyed a most
interesting dinner at the house of Flammarion, the astronomer
and novelist, who was devoted to Mars and had followed
his work at Flagstaff. As he wrote to his Father&mdash;&ldquo;There
were fourteen of us, and all that could sat in chairs
of the zodiac, under a ceiling of a pale blue sky, appropriately
dotted with fleecy clouds, and indeed most prettily painted.
Flammarion is nothing if not astronomical. His whole
apartment, which is itself au cinquieme, blossoms with such
decoration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the dinner I made the acquaintance of Miss Klumpke
of the Paris Observatory, who has just translated my last
article for the Bulletin of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Astronomique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact before he left Paris for Africa he gave a talk to that
society, on his observations of Mars. At Marseilles, meeting
his old friend, Ralph Curtis, they crossed to Algiers and
made excursions to Boghari and Biskra to test the atmosphere
on the border of the Sahara. Not finding this satisfactory,
he organized a small private caravan of his own for a journey
of a few days into the desert, taking the telescope&mdash;doubtless
the faithful six-inch&mdash;on a mule. His going off by himself
across country seems to have worried his companions for
fear he would lose his way; but he always turned up in the
afternoon, and in time to observe when the stars came out.
Curiously enough, he found that although the air was very
clear they twinkled badly, so that while the atmosphere was
transparent it was distinctly unsteady, for his purpose a very
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
grave defect which excluded North Africa from the possible
sites for his observatory. Satisfied on this point, he left
Algiers in February.</p>
<p>From Marseilles he took the opportunity to visit Schiaparelli,
to whom he owed so much of the incentive to study
Mars, and found him at his observatory in Brera near Milan.
With him he compared observations, much to his own satisfaction.
The veteran looked middle-aged, but did not expect
to make more discoveries, and said that at the preceding opposition
the weather had been so bad that he saw almost
nothing. So his mantle had definitely fallen on Percival
when he began his observations at Flagstaff the year before.</p>
<p>Leaving Milan he started to visit Leo Brenner, who was
also interested in Mars, and had his observatory at Lussinpiccolo,
a rather inaccessible spot on the eastern coast of the
Adriatic. In getting there he was much delayed by a heavy
storm, and beguiled the time by working out a mathematical
theory of the tides. Finally, he decided to go by rail to Pola,
and thence by boat to Lussinpiccolo, where Brenner met him,
insisting that he should stay with them. They proved most
hospitable and kind, but he was not favorably impressed by
the observatory or its work; and after a stay of a few days he
returned through Cannes, Paris and London, sailing for
America on March 19th, to land in New York on the 28th.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the work on the lens and its apparatus had
been finished; but it could not be set up until he was there,
and arriving at the end of March there was no time to spare.
For although the opposition of Mars did not occur until
December 10th the planets would then be far past their
nearest point, and there was much to see months before. In
fact he, with Clark, arrived at Flagstaff shortly after the
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
middle of July, and proceeded at once to put the glass into
the telescope&mdash;no small difficulty, for the tube was so tight
a fit in the dome which had housed the Brashear telescope
that the lens had to be hoisted up and let into it through the
shutter opening,&mdash;&ldquo;quite a job,&rdquo; as he wrote, &ldquo;for so delicate
and yet heavy a thing as a 24-inch lens.&rdquo; However, it was
successfully done, and the next morning at half past two
observing began, and thereafter the dome knew no rest.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<p>In the letter last quoted he says that he has &ldquo;taken a brand
new house, finished indeed after I arrived, a little gem of a
thing.&rdquo; Before long he had three houses on the hill there,
and began that succession of charming hospitalities ending
only with his life. Friends like Professor and Mrs. Barrett
Wendell and Professor Charles S. Sargent visited there, while
Professor Edward S. Morse and George R. Agassiz, who were
interested in his investigations, paid him long visits; and
since Flagstaff was on the direct road to Southern California,
a paradise becoming more and more fashionable, many others
stopped off on the way to see him and his observatory,
whom he was always delighted to entertain, for he had an
unusual capacity for doing so without interrupting the course
of his work. Then there were excursions to the cave dwellings,
the petrified forest, and other places of interest in the
neighborhood, for he loved the country about him, and took
pleasure in showing it to others. Sometimes these trips were
unusual. &ldquo;We all rode,&rdquo; he writes to a friend, &ldquo;twelve miles
out into the forest on the cow-catcher of a logging train,
visited there a hole in the ground containing, if you crawl
down through the chinks in the rocks several hundred feet, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
thing we were not accoutered to do, real ice in midsummer;
came back on the cow-catcher; and immensely enjoyed the
jaunt. The acmes of excitement were the meeting of cattle
on the track who showed much more unconcern of us than
we of them. Indeed it was usually necessary for the fireman
to get down and shoo them off.... Nevertheless we saw a
real bull fight in a pretty little valley far from men where
Greek met Greek for the possession of the herd. The two
champions toed the line with great effect.&rdquo; Nor did his interest
in literature abate, for a few weeks later he wrote to
the same correspondent: &ldquo;Send me, an&rsquo; you love me, the best
Chaucer at my expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the observations of Mars and the other planets
went on with success, and he was naturally gratified when
his telescope revealed something that others had failed to
find, such as Professor &ldquo;See&rsquo;s detection of the companion to
Sirius which astronomers have been looking for in vain since
its immersion some years ago in the rays of its primary due
to its place in its orbit. The Lick hunted for it unsuccessfully
last year&rdquo;; the last remark being pointed by the fact
that this rival had again been casting doubt upon his discoveries
on Mars.</p>
<p>He observed without a break all summer and autumn, but
aware that the atmosphere at Flagstaff was not so good in
the winter, he decided to try that of Mexico, and thither he
went in December taking the 24-inch telescope. Before the
dome therefor was built he saw well with the six-inch; but
for the larger glass the results were on the whole disappointing.
Yet the observations in Mexico were by no means unproductive.
To his father he writes: &ldquo;In addition to all that I
have told you before, Mr. Douglass has just made some interesting
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
studies of Jupiter&rsquo;s satellites, seeing them even better
than we did at Flagstaff, and detecting markings on them
so well that they promise to give the rotation periods and so
lead to another pregnant chapter in tidal evolution.&rdquo; And
in another letter to him: &ldquo;Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter&rsquo;s
satellites have all revealed new things about themselves.
I intend to embody all of these things some day in a series of
volumes on the planets.&rdquo; Meanwhile, as during the observations
of two years before, he was sending papers to various
scientific journals, American and foreign, about results obtained
on Mars, Mercury and Venus; and about this time
Sir Robert Hart asked through Professor Headland permission
to translate &ldquo;Mars&rdquo; into Chinese. One may add that the
first volume of the &ldquo;Annals of the Lowell Observatory&rdquo;
appeared that year (1897), the next in 1900.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br />ILLNESS AND ECLIPSE</h2>
<p>But his personal hopes of contributing further to science,
or diffusing the knowledge learned, were destined to be sadly
postponed. In the spring he left Mexico, and the telescope
was returned to Flagstaff in May; but although he could
stand observing day and night without sufficient sleep while
stimulated by the quest, the long strain proved too much,
and he came back to Boston nervously shattered. Such a
condition is not infrequent with scholars who work at high
speed, and although the diagnosis is simple the treatment is
uncertain. The physicians put him to bed for a month in his
father&rsquo;s house in Brookline, a measure that he always
thought a mistake, believing that he would not have collapsed
so completely under a different regimen. The progress
everyone knows who has seen it, a very slow regaining
of strength, with ups and downs, and after much discouragement&mdash;in
his case about three years&mdash;a return to normal
health.</p>
<p>After the doctors let him up from bed he sought rest in
divers places, but the progress was slow and uneven, as it
must be in such cases. Naturally letters at this period are
few, short and far between. Only two, written to his father,
appear to have been preserved, one from Bermuda, January
22, 1898:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Father:</p>
<p>I enclose what I think you will like to see, a copy made
for you of a letter just received. <i>Festina lente</i> is nature&rsquo;s
motto for me, and I try to make <i>nulla vestigia retrorsum</i>.</p>
<p><span class="center">Affectionately your son</span>
<span class="lr">Percival&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The copy enclosed is evidently of the letter from Professor
Headland conveying Sir Robert Hart&rsquo;s request to translate
&ldquo;Mars&rdquo; into Chinese. The other letter is on January 17, 1899,
with no place&mdash;date, and it says: &ldquo;Was much better; now
can&rsquo;t sleep well. So it wags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A year later, although not yet recovered, he was so much
improved as to plan with Professor Todd of Amherst an expedition
to Tripoli to observe a total eclipse of the sun. They
took a 24-inch lens, from the observatory at Amherst, with
a very light tube for transportation in four joints that would
slip inside one another, and a device for photographing the
solar corona; the lens of the telescope being the largest yet
used in such an expedition. Sending the apparatus by
freight, they themselves sailed on the German Steamship
<i>St. Paul</i> from New York on January 17, 1900. He had regained
his humor, if nothing else, for he heads his private
journal of this exploit: &ldquo;An Eclipse trip to Tripoli
being the sequel to The Valet and the Valetudinarian&rdquo;&mdash;not
that he ever wrote anything under this last title, but it
was a reference to what he had been through in the preceding
two and a half years&mdash;and after inserting two flamboyant
newspaper clippings, for which he was not responsible,
he writes: &ldquo;Further notices there were of which no
notice need be taken; literary and professional murders all,
of various degrees of atrocity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>After a few days in London, where he exchanged comments
on the spectrum of Mars with Sir William Huggins,
he passed on to Paris, and then Marseilles and Costabella
where his widowed sister, Katharine Roosevelt, was staying.
The eclipse was not to occur until the end of May, but there
was much to be done in setting up the instruments, at which
he was not needed; so as he saw his sister off for Italy he also
bade good-bye for a time to Professor Todd, who left him to
look up the telescopic apparatus and get it in place at Tripoli,
while he stayed to recuperate for three months on the Riviera.</p>
<p>Here he found William James who, with his wife, was on
a like quest to recruit from a similar case of neurasthenia,
and at the same time to prepare his Gifford lectures. To his
father Percival wrote on April 7: &ldquo;Professor William James
is living here now and we see each other all the time. He is
pleased at having just been elected a corresponding member
of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin, more for his children&rsquo;s
sake than his own. This when he thought he should never
be able to work again, and he wanted them to feel that their
father had done something. Now, however, he is stronger
and polishes off some Gifford lectures daily, a bit of it.&rdquo;
They saw much of each other, being highly sympathetic
physically and intellectually. Like himself, James had recovered,
or not lost, his sense of humor, and quoted a remark
he had heard &ldquo;that ethics was a tardy consolation for the sins
one had neglected to commit.&rdquo; And Percival was impressed
by his saying that he &ldquo;considered Darwin&rsquo;s greatness due to
his great detail as increasing the probabilities; showing
again how mere detail, mere bulk impresses, though probability
be not furthered a bit.&rdquo; The last part of the sentence
may be Percival&rsquo;s own conclusion rather than that of James,
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
but it had clearly a bearing on his own minute study of the
phenomena of Mars.</p>
<p>On the Riviera he made a number of pleasant acquaintances
and he was well enough to enjoy seeing people; but,
although he was writing a memoir for the American Academy
on Venus, he was not yet up to really hard work. After
trying in vain to think out mechanical explanations for the
small ellipticity in the orbits of the planetary satellites he gave
it up, and noted: &ldquo;I actually am taking pleasure in chronicling
this small beer (his solitary walks); pure thought
proves so thorny to press.&rdquo; On April 3d he writes to his
father: &ldquo;I am trying to catch up with you and grandfather
<i>Sed longo intervallo</i> so as to solace my solitary walks with
fixed acquaintances.&rdquo; Both of these forebears had been interested
in botany. In fact he walked much alone, studying
the trees, shrubs and insects, and he writes: &ldquo;I can converse
with plants because they don&rsquo;t talk back, nor demand attention
but accept it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time for the eclipse was drawing near, so after going
to Florence to spend a few days more with his sister, he sailed
from Genoa on May 16; trans-shipped at Naples, and going
ashore in Sicily and Malta while the steamer was in port,
reached Tripoli on May 24th. Travelling to out-of-the-way
places in the Mediterranean was not a rapid process, and
Tripoli then belonged to Turkey; but he found everything
prepared by Professor Todd in the grounds of the American
Consulate, and, fortunately, when the eclipse occurred four
days later the sky was clear and everything went well. He
was amused by the comments of the ignorant. &ldquo;The Arabs,&rdquo;
he wrote in his private journal, &ldquo;the common folk, told their
friends (beforehand) that the Christians lied, and when the
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
affair came off, that they had no business to know being
infidel.&rdquo; But he was as always interested in their ways and
habits, mousing about the town with our consul and others,
learning about the Turkish troops, and the Tuaureg camel
drivers, inspecting a bakery, a macaroni factory, threshing
and the weekly fair.</p>
<p>On June 3rd they sailed by an Italian steamer for Malta,
but he left it at Tunis to go to the ruins of Carthage, which
impressed him greatly; catching the boat again at Biserta,
and at Malta trans-shipping again for Marseilles, he made
his way to Paris. There the exhibition was open, and among
other things he found his exhibit from Flagstaff, &ldquo;poor waif,
in a corner of the Palais de l&rsquo;Optique and in another place
stood confronted by four of my own drawings of Mars, unlabelled,
unsubscribed. Felt badly for the poor orphans.&rdquo; He
did not stay long, but went to England, and after spending a
few days at the country house of some friends he had made
on the Riviera, he sailed for home on July 4th. Shortly before
leaving he had received telegrams telling of his father&rsquo;s unexpected
death under an operation, cutting another link
with his earlier life.</p>
<p>As yet not well enough to resume his work, he hired a
farm house at Chocorua, and settled there on August 3rd for
the rest of the summer. He enjoyed seeing the friends and
neighbors who spent their vacations there; but, like some
other men of science incapacitated by illness, he turned his
attention to a field other than his own. As on the Riviera,
this was flowers, butterflies, and especially trees; but he
studied them more systematically, and with fuller notes. In
October he gives a list, covering more than three pages, of
the trees and shrubs in the woods, fields and swamps about
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
him in the order of their abundance. This interest he kept
up in later years at Flagstaff, corresponding with Professor
Charles S. Sargent, the Director of the Arnold Arboretum,
and sending him specimens of rare or unknown varieties,
some of which were named after him. So highly, indeed, did
Sargent rate him that after Percival&rsquo;s death he wrote a
memoir of him in <i>Rhodora</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> which it is well to transcribe in
full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That Percival Lowell took an active interest in trees was
probably not known to many persons, for he published only one
botanical paper and he had no botanical associates except in this
Arboretum. It is not surprising that a man with his active and
inquiring mind brought up in New England should, when he
found himself in Arizona, want to know something of the strange
plants which grew everywhere about him and which were so entirely
unlike the plants which he had known as a boy in Massachusetts,
and later in Japan and Korea. The love of plants, too,
was in his blood and only needed the opportunity of this new
field to make itself felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Percival Lowell&rsquo;s great great grandfather, John Lowell, was
one of the original members of the Massachusetts Society for Promoting
Agriculture and its second President, serving from 1796
until his death in 1802. He is less well known for his connection
with rural affairs than his son John Lowell, spoken of generally
in his day as &ldquo;the Norfolk Farmer,&rdquo; and a generous and successful
promoter of scientific agriculture and horticulture in Massachusetts,
whom Daniel Webster called &ldquo;the uniform friend of all
sorts of rural economy.&rdquo; The second John Lowell became a member
of the Agricultural Society in 1816 and served from the time
of his election until 1830 as its Corresponding Secretary, and as
one of the editors of its publication, <i>The Massachusetts Agricultural
Repository and Journal</i>. During these years articles by him
on agriculture, horticulture and forestry are found in almost every
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
number. In volume v. published in 1819 there is an important
paper by John Lowell on &ldquo;The Gradual Diminution of the Forests
of Massachusetts, and the importance of early attention to
some effectual remedy, with extracts from the work of M. Michaux
on the Forest Trees of North America.&rdquo; Volume vii. contains
articles from his pen on &ldquo;Some slight notice of the Larch tree
(<i>Pinus Larix</i>), known in various parts of the country under the
several names of Juniper, Hackmatack, and Larch&rdquo;; on &ldquo;Fruit
Trees,&rdquo; signed by the Norfolk Gardener, and on &ldquo;Raising the Oak
from the Acorn and the best way of doing it.&rdquo; The last volume of
this publication which appeared in 1832, when he was seventy-one
years old, contains an article by John Lowell on &ldquo;The Extraordinary
Destruction of the last Year&rsquo;s Wood in Forest Trees and the
probable Causes of it&rdquo;; and on &ldquo;Live Hedges for New England.&rdquo;
The second John Lowell was active in establishing and maintaining
the Botanic Garden of Harvard College and was one of the
original members of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. To
the first annual festival of the Horticultural Society held in the
Exchange Coffee House on State Street, September 19, 1829, he
sent from his greenhouses in Roxbury Orange-trees covered with
flowers and fruit and a bunch of grapes weighing three pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Amory Lowell, the son of the second John Lowell and
the grandfather of Percival Lowell, was deeply interested in
botany and in 1845, thirty years after his graduation from Harvard
College, began the collection of an herbarium and botanical library
with the purpose of devoting himself seriously to the study of
plants. He had made valuable collections and a large botanical
library when the financial troubles of 1857 forced him to abandon
botany and devote himself again to business affairs. His most
valuable books were given by him to his friend Asa Gray and
now form an important part of the library of the Gray Herbarium.
His herbarium and his other botanical books were given to the
Boston Society of Natural History. John Amory Lowell, like his
father and grandfather, was a member of the Massachusetts
Society for Promoting Agriculture. He was succeeded by his son
John Lowell, who in turn was succeeded by his son, another
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
John Lowell, who of the fifth generation in direct descent from
its second president is now a Trustee of this Society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Percival Lowell&rsquo;s love of plants certainly came to him naturally.
I first met him in the Arboretum many years ago examining the
collection of Asiatic Viburnums in which he was interested at
that time, but it was not until 1910 that he began to send specimens
to the Arboretum, including that of an Oak which he had
found growing near his observatory and which so far as it is possible
to judge is an undescribed species. Interest in this Oak led
him to look for other individuals and to extend his botanical explorations.
During these he visited Oak Creek Canyon, a deep
cut with precipitous sides in the Colorado plateau which heads
about twenty miles south of Flagstaff and carries in its bottom a
small stream which finally finds its way into the Verde northwest
and not far from Camp Verde. Lowell appears to have been the
first botanist who visited the upper part, at least, of this canyon
where he found a number of interesting plants, notably <i>Platanus
Wrightii</i> and <i>Quercus arizonica</i>, which before his explorations
were not known to extend into the United States from Mexico
beyond the canyons of the mountain ranges of southern Arizona
and New Mexico. In Oak Creek Canyon Lowell found a new
Ash-tree somewhat intermediate between <i>Fraxinus quadrangulata</i>
of the east and <i>F. anomala</i> of our southwestern deserts which
will bear his name. Later Lowell explored Sycamore Canyon
which is west of Oak Creek Canyon and larger and deeper than
Oak Creek Canyon and, like it, cuts through the Colorado plateau
and finally reaches the Verde near the mouth of Oak Creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juniperus in several species abound on the Colorado plateau,
and Lowell became deeply interested in these trees and was preparing
to write a monograph of our southwestern species. His
observations on the characters and altitudinal range of the different
species, illustrated by abundant material, have been of great
service to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lowell&rsquo;s only botanical paper, published in the May and June
issues of the <i>Bulletin of the American Geographic Society</i> in 1909,
is entitled &ldquo;The Plateau of the San Francisco Peaks in its Effect
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
on Tree Life.&rdquo; In this paper, which is illustrated by photographs
made by the author of all the important trees of the region, he
discusses the altitudinal distribution of these trees, dividing his
region into five zones which he illustrates by a number of charts
showing the distribution of vegetation in each. It contains, too,
an important and interesting discussion of the influence on temperature
and therefore on tree growth of the larger body of earth
in a plateau as compared with a mountain peak where, on account
of greater exposure, the earth cools more rapidly.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;A bundle of cuttings of what is probably a new species of
Willow, to obtain which Lowell had made a long and hard
journey, with his last letter and a photograph of the Willow,
came only a few days before the telegram announcing his death.
Botany therefore occupied his thoughts during his last days on
earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The death of Percival Lowell is a severe loss to the Arboretum.
He understood its purpose and sympathized with its efforts to
increase knowledge. Few collectors of plants have shown greater
enthusiasm or more imagination, and living as he did in what he
has himself described as &ldquo;one of the most interesting regions of
the globe&rdquo; there is every reason to believe that as a botanist
Percival Lowell would have become famous.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br />MARS AND ITS CANALS</h2>
<p>By the early spring of 1901 Percival was well over his
illness, and fit to return to the Observatory for the oppositions
of Mars in that year, in 1903 and in 1905. Shortly after he
came back the services of Mr. Douglass came to an end, and
he was fortunate in obtaining Dr. V. M. Slipher in 1901
and Mr. C. O. Lampland in the following year&mdash;two young
men who were not only invaluable assistants to him, but
during his lifetime, and ever since, have made distinguished
contributions to science. Observing at all hours of the
night was exacting work; and to anyone less enthusiastic,
who did not see through the detail to its object, it might
have been monotonous and wearisome. As he wrote himself,
&ldquo;Patient plodding is the road to results in science, and
the shortest road in the end. Each year out here has seemed
to me the best, which merely means that I hope I learn a
little and that there is a vast deal to learn.&rdquo; He felt strongly
the need of diligence and strict impartiality in ascertaining
the facts, and distinguished it sharply from the imagination
to be used in interpreting them. In describing his delineation
of the canals he says, &ldquo;Each drawing, it should be remembered,
was as nearly an instantaneous picture of the disk as
possible. It covered only a few minutes of observation, and
was made practically as if the observer had never seen the
planet before. In other words, the man was sunk in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
manner. Such mental effacement is as vital to good observation
as mental assertion is afterward to pregnant reasoning.
For a man should be a machine in collecting his
data, a mind in co&ouml;rdinating them. To reverse the process,
as is sometimes done, is not conducive to science.&rdquo; But
through all the exacting labor of the search he felt keenly
the joy of discovery, comparing himself to the explorers of
the Earth, and in the first chapter of &ldquo;Mars and its Canals&rdquo;
he tells us of the pleasure of a winter night spent in the Observatory.</p>
<p>The oppositions in 1901, 1903 and 1905 were not so favorable
as those of 1894 and 1906-1907, because Mars was not so
near the Earth; the eccentricities in the orbits of the two
planets causing them to pass each other when Mars was far
from the Sun and therefore from the Earth whose eccentricity
is less. Yet they had an advantage in the fact that,
unlike the earlier occasions, the south pole was tipped away
from the Earth, and the north pole was toward it, thus giving
a good view of the northern polar cap, sub-arctic and
higher temperate zones, which had not been visible before.
Thus the seasonal changes could be observed in the opposite
hemisphere,&mdash;not an inconsiderable gain, because the dark
and light areas, that is, the natural vegetation and the deserts,
are not equally distributed over the planet, for the dark ones
occupy a much larger part of the southern, and the deserts
of the northern, hemisphere. Moreover, the use of a larger
lens and better atmosphere had shown that observations
could be carried on profitably for a longer period before and
after the actual opposition; until in 1905 it was possible to
cover what had been left unobserved of the Martian year
in the northern half of Mars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>No sooner was the third of these oppositions past than he
wrote another book on the subject, with the title &ldquo;Mars and
its Canals&rdquo;; and this in no sense a supplement to the earlier
one, but an entirely new and independent presentation of
the subject, covering the old ground and much more. He
was enabled to do this because the copyright of the earlier
work belonged to him. The later one was published by The
Macmillan Company in December 1906, and dedicated to
Schiaparelli. Like the earlier book, he wrote it by no means
for astronomers alone, but for the interested public; and in
the preface he tells why he did so: &ldquo;To set forth science in a
popular, that is in a generally understandable, form is as obligatory
as to present it in a more technical manner. If men
are to benefit by it, it must be expressed to their comprehension.
To do this should be feasible for him who is master
of his subject, and is both the best test of, and the
best training to that post.... Nor is it so hard to make
any well-grasped matter comprehensible to a man of good
general intelligence as is commonly supposed. The whole
object of science is to synthesize, and so simplify; and did
we but know the uttermost of a subject we could make
it singularly clear.&rdquo; At the same time there was nothing
in these writings of the nature of what is commonly
called popularizing science. He expounded his subject in a
strictly scientific way, but avoided unfamiliar technical
terms if possible, and sought to raise his readers or audience
to his level of thought, not to descend to theirs. Such
statements for the public were very often preceded by technical
ones in the Bulletins of the Observatory or elsewhere,
and yet it cannot be doubted that the former tended to alienate
some scientific scholars who were slow to admit his discoveries,
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
and did not sympathize with his method of presenting
them, or perhaps with the attractive style of the
man of letters as well as of exact thought.</p>
<p>Still there are pitfalls in taking the public into one&rsquo;s confidence;
as he found in December 1900, when a telegram sent
by the usual channels to the astronomical world, that the
night before a projection had been observed on Mars that
lasted seventy minutes, was taken by the press to mean an
attempt by Martians to signal to the Earth, and as such was
proclaimed all over America and Europe. The cause of the
excitement, as he explained a year later to the American
Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, was the reflection from
a cloud on the horizon of the planet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mars and its Canals&rdquo; is frankly a demonstration that the
planet is habitable, and that from what takes place there it
must in fact be inhabited by highly intelligent beings. For
that purpose the book is divided into four parts, entitled:
Natural Features; Non-Natural (that is, artificial) Features;
The Canals in Action; and Explanation. His general thesis,
which he was to expound more fully later (and which although
not essential to his argument for life on Mars he connected
therewith) was that all planets go through the
same process of development&mdash;varying, however, with their
size which determines their power to retain the gases
of their atmosphere&mdash;and that one element therein is
the gradual leakage of water through cracks into its interior
as the planet cools. He cites geologists to prove
that the oceans formerly covered much more of the surface
of the Earth than they do now; argues that the desert
belts around it are of comparatively recent geologic origin, as
shown by the petrified forest of Arizona; and points out the
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
similarity in color, as seen from the San Francisco Peaks, of
the forested hills and the painted desert there, to that of the
blue-green and reddish-ochre spaces of Mars as presented by
the telescope. He notes also that to get water in our deserts
plants and animals have sought the higher altitudes, and are
able to exist and multiply in an air less dense and a climate
cooler with a shorter warm season than in their natural
habitat, adjusting themselves to these conditions.</p>
<p>This idea of the lack of water on Mars he derives from
observation of its surface and the changes thereon; for the
supply of water is in great part locked up in the snow or ice
of the polar caps during the Martian winters of the two
hemispheres and distributed over its surface as summer
comes on. Therefore he naturally begins his account of the
natural features of the planet by a description of these polar
snow caps, their formation and melting. In doing so he
cannot resist a sarcastic reference to the endless enthusiasm,
useless expenditure of money and labor, and the scientific
futility of arctic exploration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polar expeditions exert an extreme attraction on certain
minds, perhaps because they combine the maximum of
hardship with the minimum of headway. Inconclusiveness
certainly enables them to be constantly renewed, without
loss either of purpose or prestige. The fact that the pole has
never been trod by man constitutes the lodestone to such
undertakings; and that it continues to defy him only whets
his endeavor the more. Except for the demonstration of the
polar drift-current conceived of and then verified by Nansen,
very little has been added by them to our knowledge of the
globe. Nor is there specific reason to suppose that what they
might add would be particularly vital. Nothing out of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
way is suspected of the pole beyond the simple fact of being
so positioned. Yet for their patent inconclusion they continue
to be sent in sublime superiority to failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martian polar expeditions, as undertaken by the astronomers,
are the antipodes of these pleasingly perilous excursions
in three important regards, which if less appealing to
the gallery commend themselves to the philosopher. They
involve comparatively little hardship; they have accomplished
what they set out to do; and the knowledge they have
gleaned has proved fundamental to an understanding of the
present physical condition of the planet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then follows the story of the melting of the polar snows,
the darkening of the blue-green areas by the growth of vegetation
due to the flow of water; and a summary, at the close
of [Part I] (Natural Features), of the reasons for believing
that from its atmosphere, temperature, and the actual, though
scanty, supply of water, Mars is capable of supporting life.
In fact the presence of vegetation proves that life of that kind
does exist, in spite of the fact that five-eighths of the surface
is desert; and if plants can live animals might also. But,
unlike vegetation, they could not be readily seen, and save in
the case of intelligent operation on a large scale, their presence
could not be detected. This is the significance of the
canals, to which much of the observation of the last three
oppositions was directed.</p>
<p>Close to the limit of vision, and only to be seen at moments
when the atmosphere is steady, the fainter canals are very
hard to observe. Percival describes the experience in this
way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a fairly acute eyed observer sets himself to scan the
telescopic disk of the planet in steady air, he will, after noting
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
the dazzling contour of the white polar cap and the sharp
outlines of the blue-green areas, of a sudden be made aware
of a vision as of a thread stretched somewhere from the blue-green
across the orange areas of the disk. Gone as quickly as
it came, he will instinctively doubt his own eyesight, and
credit to illusion what can so unaccountably disappear.
Gaze as hard as he will, no power of his can recall it, when,
with the same startling abruptness, the thing stands before
his eyes again. Convinced, after three or four such showings,
that the vision is real, he will still be left wondering
what and where it was. For so short and sudden are its apparitions
that the locating of it is dubiously hard. It is gone
each time before he has got its bearings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By persistent watch, however, for the best instants of
definition, backed by the knowledge of what he is to see, he
will find its coming more frequent, more certain and more
detailed. At last some particularly propitious moment will
disclose its relation to well known points and its position be
assured. First one such thread and then another will make
its presence evident; and then he will note that each always
appears in place. Repetition <i>in situ</i> will convince him that
these strange visitants are as real as the main markings, and
are as permanent as they.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough fine lines, from the continuity of the
impression they make upon the eye, can be recognized when
of a thickness that would be invisible in the case of a mere
dot. To determine how narrow a line on Mars would be
perceptible, experiments were made with a wire of a certain
size, noting the limit of distance at which it could be seen;
and then, from the magnifying power of the telescope, it
was found that a Martian canal would be visible down to
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
about a mile wide. From this the conclusion was drawn that
the canals probably ran from two or three up to fifteen or
twenty miles in width, the minimum being much less than
had been thought at earlier oppositions. The distance apart
of the two branches of double canals he estimated at about
seventy-five to one hundred and eighty miles, save in one
case where, if a true instance of doubling, it is over four hundred.
Of the oases, whereof one hundred and eighty-six had
been observed, much the larger part were from seventy-five
to one hundred miles in diameter.</p>
<p>The later oppositions enabled him also to complete the
topography of the planet, showing that the canals were a
vast system, running from the borders of both polar caps,
through the dark areas of natural vegetation where they
connected, at obviously convenient points, with a still more
complex network in the ochre, or desert, regions, and thus
across the equator into the corresponding system in the other
hemisphere. By this network the greater part of the canals
could receive water alternately from the melting of the north
and south polar caps, or twice yearly, the Martian year, however,
being almost twice as long as our own. But to perfect
his proof that this actually takes place he had to show that
the canals, that is the streaks of vegetation bordering waterways,
sprang into life&mdash;thereby becoming visible or darker&mdash;in
succession as the water spread from the poles to the
tropics; and this he did with his usual thoroughness at the
opposition of 1903.</p>
<p>Since there was then no mechanical means of measuring
the variations in visibility of the canals,&mdash;and under the
atmospheric conditions at any place in the world perhaps
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
there never will be,&mdash;the record had to be made by the eye,
that is in drawings by the observer as he saw the canals; and
these, as he said, must be numerous, consecutive and extended
in time. The consecutive could not be perfectly carried
out because &ldquo;as Mars takes about forty minutes longer
to turn than the Earth, such confronting (of the observer)
occurs later and later each night by about forty minutes,
until finally it does not occur at all while Mars is suitably
above the horizon; then the feature passes from sight to remain
hidden till the difference of the rotations brings it
round into view again. There are thus times when a given
region is visible, times when it is not, and these succeed each
other in from five to six weeks, and are called presentations.
For about a fortnight at each presentation a region is centrally
enough placed to be well seen; for the rest of the
period either ill-placed or on the other side of the planet.&rdquo;
But with changes as gradual and continuous as those of the
darkening of the canals this did not prove a serious drawback
to the continuity of the record.</p>
<p>There was another element in the problem. The drawing
being the estimate of the observer on the comparative darkness
of the markings from time to time it was of the greatest
importance to avoid any variation in personal estimates, and
therefore Percival made all the drawings himself. From
April 6 to May 26 he drew the planet every twenty-four
hours, and although &ldquo;the rest of the time did not equal this
perfection, no great gap occurred, and one hundred and
forty-three nights were utilized in all.... But even this does
not give an idea of the mass of the data. For by the method
employed about 100 drawings were used in the case of each
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
canal, and as 109 canals were examined this gave 10,900
separate determinations upon which the ultimate result depended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For each canal he plotted the curve of its diminishing or
increasing visibility as the season advanced, and this curve
he called the cartouche of the canal. Now combining the
cartouches of all the canals in each zone of latitude, he found
that those in the several zones began to become more distinct&mdash;that
is the vegetation began to come to life&mdash;in a regular
and approximately uniform succession, taking from the
northern arctic down to the equator and past it to the southern
sub-tropic about eighty Martian days. From north latitude
72&deg; to the equator, a distance of 2,650 miles, took fifty-two
of these days, at a speed of fifty-one miles a day, or 2.1
miles an hour. Now all this is precisely the opposite of what
happens on the Earth, where vegetation in the spring starts
in the part of the temperate zone nearest to the equator, and
as the season advances travels toward the pole; the reason for
the difference being, he says, that what is needed on Earth to
make the sap run is the warmth of the sun, what is needed
on Mars is water that comes from the melting of the polar
snows. He points out also that the water cannot flow through
the canals by nature, because on the surface of a planet in
equilibrium gravity would not draw it in any direction
toward or away from the equator. &ldquo;No natural force propels
it, and the inference is forthright and inevitable that it is
artificially helped to its end. There seems to be no escape
from this deduction.&rdquo; In short, since water certainly cannot
flow by gravity both ways in the same canal, the inhabitants
of Mars have not only dug the canals, but pump
the water through them.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>In recapitulating the reasons for the artificial character of
the canals he shows a most natural annoyance with people
who doubted the validity of his observations; and, in dealing
with the evidence to be drawn from the fact that they run on
great circles, that is on the shortest lines from one point to another,
he writes: &ldquo;For it is the geodetic precision which the
lines exhibit that instantly stamps them to consciousness as
artificial. The inference is so forthright as to be shared by
those who have not seen them to the extent of instant denial
of their objectivity. Drawings of them look too strange to be
true. So scepticism imputes to the draftsman their artificial
fashioning, not realizing that by so doing it bears unconscious
witness to their character. For in order to disprove
the deduction it is driven to deny the fact. Now the fact
can look after itself and will be recognized in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last prophecy was largely verified before these three
oppositions of the planet came to an end. In 1901 photography
was tried without success so far as the canals were concerned.
For the stars it had worked very well, for to quote
again: &ldquo;Far less sensitive than the retina the dry plate has one
advantage over its rival,&mdash;its action is cumulative. The eye
sees all it can in the twentieth of a second; after that its perception,
instead of increasing, is dulled, and no amount of
application will result in adding more. With the dry plate
it is the reverse. Time works for, not against it. Within
limits, themselves long, light affects it throughout the period
it stands exposed and, roughly speaking, in direct ratio to
the time elapsed. Thus the camera is able to record stars no
human eye has ever caught and to register the structure of
nebulae the eye tries to resolve in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where illumination alone is concerned the camera reigns
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
supreme; not so when it comes to a question of definition.
Then by its speed and agility the eye steps into its place, for
the atmosphere is not the void it could be wished, through
which the light-waves shoot at will. Pulsing athwart it are
air-waves of condensation and rarefaction that now obstruct,
now further, the passage of the ray. By the nimbleness of its
action the eye cunningly contrives to catch the good moments
among the poor and carry their message to the brain. The
dry plate by its slowness is impotent to follow. To register
anything it must take the bad with the better to a complete
confusion of detail. For the air-waves throw the image first
to one place and then to another, to a blotting of both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There lay the difficulty which Mr. Lampland, then new to
the Observatory, took up in 1903. The photographs, though
better, still did not show the canals. Various adjustments
were then made with the telescope; all manner of plates were
tried between the rapid and the well-defining ones; and
finally in 1905 upon the plates canals appeared, thirty-eight
in all and one of them double.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> On learning of the success
Schiaparelli wrote in wonder to Percival, &ldquo;I should never
have believed it possible&rdquo;; and the British Royal Photographic
Society awarded its medal to Mr. Lampland.</p>
<p>With the observations of 1905 ended until the next opposition
of the planet an exploration and a romance of which
he wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To some people it may seem that the very strangeness of
Martian life precludes for it an appeal to human interest.
To me this is but a near-sighted view. The less the life there
proves a counterpart of our earthly state of things, the more
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
it fires fancy and piques inquiry as to what it be. We all have
felt this impulse in our childhood as our ancestors did before
us, when they conjured goblins and spirits from the vasty
void, and if our energy continue we never cease to feel its
force through life. We but exchange, as our years increase,
the romance of fiction for the more thrilling romance of
fact. As we grow older we demand reality, but so this
requisite be fulfilled the stranger the realization the better
we are pleased. Perhaps it is the more vivid imagination of
youth that enables us all then to dispense with the hall-mark
of actuality upon our cherished visions; perhaps a deeper
sense of our own oneness with nature as we get on makes us
insist upon getting the real thing. Whatever the reason be,
certain it is that with the years a narration, no matter how
enthralling, takes added hold of us for being true. But
though we crave this solid foothold for our conceptions, we
yield on that account no jot or tittle of our interest for the
unexpected.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br />THE SOLAR SYSTEM</h2>
<p>In the intervals of personal observation Percival was often
giving lectures or writing on astronomical subjects for the
publications of the Observatory, and for scientific societies
and periodicals. The substance of most of these found their
way into his books, which are summations or expositions of
his conclusions. In December 1902, for example, he gave six
lectures on &ldquo;The Solar System&rdquo; at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, of which he was a non-resident professor,
and they were published by Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Company.
Then in the autumn of 1906 he gave a course of eight lectures
at the Lowell Institute in Boston on &ldquo;Mars as the Abode of
Life.&rdquo; These were so crowded that they had to be repeated,
were then printed as six papers in the <i>Century Magazine</i>, and
finally re-published by The Macmillan Company under the
same title. Two years later, in the winter of 1909, he gave at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, another course of
six lectures on &ldquo;Cosmic Physics: The Evolution of Worlds,&rdquo;
which were brought out in December by the same publisher
with the latter half of the title. Although their names
are so diverse, and far more is told of Mars in the book
whose title contains its name, they all deal essentially with
the same subject, the evolution of the planets and the development
and end of life upon them. In the Preface to
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
&ldquo;Mars as the Abode of Life,&rdquo;&mdash;for a preface, although
printed at the beginning, is always written after the book
is finished, and is the author&rsquo;s last word to the reader, giving
his latest thought as the work is being launched,&mdash;he tells
us:<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> &ldquo;Though dealing specifically with Mars, the theme of
the lectures was that of planetary evolution in general, and
this book is thus a presentation of something which Professor
Lowell has long had in mind and of which his studies of
Mars form but a part, the research into the genesis and development
of what we call a world; not the mere aggregating
of matter, but what that aggregation inevitably brings
forth. The subject which links the Nebular Hypothesis to the
Darwinian Theory, bridging the evolutionary gap between
the two, he has called planetology, thus designating the history
of the planet&rsquo;s individual career. It is in this light that
Mars is here regarded: how it came to be what it is and how
it came to differ from the Earth in the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At each opposition, in fact at every opposition during
Percival&rsquo;s life and long thereafter, Mars was observed at
Flagstaff and more detail was discovered confirming what
had been found before. He tells of a slight change in the
estimated tilt in its axis; the fact that the temperature is
warmer than was earlier supposed;<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> and he had found how
to discover the gases by spectroscopic analysis applied according
to an ingenious device of his own known as &ldquo;Velocity Shift&rdquo;
and much used thereafter.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> He tells also of an
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
ingenious and elaborate experiment with wires, and with
lines on a wooden disk, which showed that such lines can be
perceived at a greater distance and therefore of smaller size
than had been supposed, so that the canals might have less
width than had been assumed. It is, however, needless, in
describing his planetary theory, to do more than allude to his
evidence of Martian habitation drawn from the canals, with
which the reader is already familiar. Curiously enough, however,
it is interesting to note that on September 9, 1909, about
the time when &ldquo;The Evolution of Worlds&rdquo; was going to
press, a strange phenomenon appeared in Mars. Two striking
canals were seen where none had ever been seen before,
and the most conspicuous on that part of the disk. Moreover,
they were photographed. After examining all the maps of
canals made at Flagstaff and elsewhere, Percival discussed
them in the Observatory Bulletin No. 45, and concluded that
they must not only be new to us, but new to Mars since its
previous corresponding season of two of our years before:
&ldquo;something <i>extra ordinem naturae</i>.&rdquo; We may here leave
Mars for the time, and turn to the more extensive study of
the evolution of the planetary system.</p>
<p>The desire to rise from a particular case to a more general
law was characteristic of his attitude of mind, constructive
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
and insatiable, and appears throughout these volumes. It may
have been influenced by his great master Benjamin Peirce,
who ever treated any mathematical formula as a special instance
of a more comprehensive one. In such a subject as the
evolution of the planets, especially of life on them, it involved
dipping into many sciences, beyond the physical laws
of matter; and he says in the same preface: &ldquo;As in all theses,
the cogency of the conclusion hangs upon the validity of each
step in the argument. It is vital that each of these should be
based on all that we know of natural laws and the general
principles underlying them.&rdquo; This did not mean that all his
premises would be universally accepted, but that he found
out all he could about them, convincing himself of their accuracy
and of the validity of the conclusions he draws therefrom.
That is all any man of science can do in a subject
larger than his own special, and therefore limited, field.</p>
<p>But from the time of his resumption of research and the
direction of the observatory in 1901, he was constantly enlarging
his own field by the study of astrophysical subjects,
and the methods for their determination. With this object he
was initiating and encouraging planetary photography. He
was constantly writing Dr. V. M. Slipher about procuring
and using spectrographic apparatus and about the results obtained
by him therefrom. By this process the rotations of
planets were determined; and the spectra of the major ones&mdash;often
reproduced in astronomical works&mdash;have been a
puzzle to astrophysicists until their interpretation in very
recent years. He was interested also in nebulae, especially
in spiral ones, taking part in Dr. Slipher&rsquo;s pioneering spectrographic
work at the observatory, which showed that they
were vast aggregations of stars of different spectral types,
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
moving with great speed, and far beyond the limits of our
universe. For over fifteen years the observatory was almost
alone in this field of research, as well as in that of globular
clusters. It is in fact, the discovery of the rapid motion of the
spiral nebulae away from the solar system that has given
rise to the conception of an expanding universe.</p>
<p>But these discoveries were still largely in the future, and
to return to his books on the planetary system it may be
noted that in the two larger and more popular ones the
general planetary theory is expounded in the text, while the
demonstrations of the more complex statements made, and
the mathematical calculations involved, are relegated to a
mass of notes at the end of the volume.</p>
<p>The first of his books on the solar system is the small volume
bearing that title; but since all three of the books here
described are several expositions of the same subject it may
be well to treat his views on each topic in connection with
the work in which he deals with it most fully. Indeed, &ldquo;The
Solar System&rdquo; is not a general treatise, but rather a discussion
of some striking points, and it is these which one thinks of
in connection therewith.</p>
<p>In considering the origin of the planets he had become
much interested in the meteors, shooting stars, meteoric
streams and comets, all or almost all of which he regarded
as parts of the solar system, revolving about the Sun in
elliptic orbits, often so eccentric as to appear parabolas.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> The
old idea that comets came from outer space and therefore
travelled in hyperbolas can, he points out, be true of few, if
any, of them. &ldquo;Very few, three or four perhaps, hint at
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
hyperbolas. Not one is such beyond question.&rdquo; Many of
them are associated with the meteoric streams with which
everyone is familiar at certain seasons of the year. Indeed
seventy-six of these associations were then known, and comets
sometimes break up into such streams.</p>
<p>Now if the comets are travelling in orbits around the Sun
they must be throughout their course within its control, and
not within that of some other star; and therefore he computes
how far the Sun&rsquo;s control extends. Taking for this
purpose our nearest star, &alpha; Centauri, a double with a total
mass twice that of the Sun, at a distance of 275,000 astronomical
units, in other words that number of times our distance
from the Sun, he finds that the point at which its attraction
and that of the Sun become equal is 114,000 of these
units. This he calls the extent of the Sun&rsquo;s domain, certainly
an area large enough for any, or almost any, comet
known.<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>
<p>He then turns to some of the planets,&mdash;Mercury to show
the effect of tidal action in slowing the rotation of a planet
or satellite, and causing it to turn the same face always to its
master.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> This involved a highly interesting comparison of
Newton&rsquo;s theory of the tides, long generally accepted, but
not taking enough account of the planet&rsquo;s rotation, and that
of Sir George Darwin based upon the effect of such rotation.
The general conceptions are even more different than the results,
and the later theory is less concerned with the tides in
oceans, which probably affect only our Earth, than with
those of a planet in a fluid or viscous condition, which may
still continue to some extent after the surface has become
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
partly solidified. He therefore studies the tide raising force,
and the tendency to retardation of rotation, by the Sun on the
planets, and by these on their satellites while still in a fluid
state, tabulating some very striking results.</p>
<p>What he says about Mars is more fully dealt with in his
other writings; and the same is true of Saturn&rsquo;s rings, except
for the reference to the calculation by Edward Roche of the
limit of possible approach by a fluid satellite to its planet
without being disrupted, and for the fact that this limit in
Saturn&rsquo;s case falls just beyond the outer edge of the rings. In
discussing Saturn&rsquo;s satellites he brings out a curious analogy
between the order of distribution of these attendants of the
three best known major planets and the order of the planets
themselves about the Sun. In each case the largest of the
bodies so revolving is nearly in the centre of the line, as in
the case of Jupiter among the planets; the second largest the
next, or not far, beyond, as in the case of Saturn; while
there is another maximum farther in, for as the Earth is
larger than any planet on either side until Jupiter is reached,
so a like order is found in the satellites of Jupiter, Saturn and
Uranus. In other words, the size in each case rises with increasing
distance, falls off, then rises again to the largest and
thence declines. This he believed cannot be an accidental
coincidence, but the result of a law of development as yet
unexplained.</p>
<p>To the ordinary reader the most novel thing he says about
Jupiter relates to its family of comets, for no less than thirty-two
of these bodies have their aphelia, or greatest distance
from the Sun, near its orbit. Moreover, their ascending
nodes&mdash;that is the place where their paths if inclined to the
plane of the ecliptic pass through it&mdash;are close to its orbit.
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
At some time, therefore, in the vast ages of the past they must
have passed close to the planet, and if so have had their
orbits greatly changed by its attraction. He considers the
various effects Jupiter may have upon a comet, and shows&mdash;contrary
to the opinion of Professor H. A. Newton&mdash;that
any such body moving by the attraction of the Sun
would be going too fast for Jupiter to capture completely.
Then he takes up other effects of deflection. The comet&rsquo;s
speed may be accelerated and its direction changed even so
much as to drive it out of the solar system; it may be retarded
so that its path is contracted and the aphelion drawn nearer
to the planet&rsquo;s orbit. After calculating the possible conditions
and analyzing the actual orbits of Jupiter&rsquo;s family, he
comes to the provisional conclusion that these comets have
been drawn from the neighborhood. &ldquo;It is certain,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;that Jupiter has swept his neighborhood.... If we consider
the comet aphelia of short-period comets, we shall notice
that they are clustered about the path of Jupiter and the path
of Saturn, thinning out to a neutral ground between, where
there are none. Two-thirds of the way from Jupiter&rsquo;s orbit
to Saturn&rsquo;s, space is clear of them, the centre of the gap falling
at 8.4 astronomical units from the sun....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jupiter is not the only planet that has a comet family. All
the large planets have the like. Saturn has a family of two,
Uranus also of two, Neptune of six; and the spaces between
these planets are clear of comet aphelia; the gaps prove the
action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor does the action, apparently, stop there. Plotting the
aphelia of all the comets that have been observed, we find,
as we go out from the Sun, clusters of them at first, representing,
respectively, Jupiter&rsquo;s, Saturn&rsquo;s, Uranus&rsquo;, and Neptune&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
family;<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> but the clusters do not stop with Neptune.
Beyond that planet is a gap, and then at 49 and 50 astronomical
units we find two more aphelia, and then nothing again
till we reach 75 units out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This can hardly be accident; and if not chance, it means
a planet out there as yet unseen by man, but certain sometime
to be detected and added to the others. Thus not only
are comets a part of our system now recognized, but they act
as finger-posts to planets not yet known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We shall hear more of this last suggestion hereafter.</p>
<p>In both &ldquo;Mars as the Abode of Life&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Evolution
of Worlds,&rdquo; he accepts the proposition that our present
solar system began with a collision with some dark body
from interstellar space, as had been suggested by Chamberlin
and Moulton a few years before. He points out that
stars which have finished contracting, grown cold and ceased
to be luminous, must exist, and although we cannot see them
directly we know about some of them,&mdash;such as the dark
companion of Algol, revolving around it and cutting off
two-thirds of its light every three days. Many dark wanderers
there must be, and the <i>novae</i>, as he says, are sometimes,
at least, due to a collision with such a body,&mdash;not
necessarily an actual impact, but an approach so near that
the star is sprung asunder by the tidal effect. In such a case
the opposite sides of the victim would be driven away from
it, and if it was rotating would form spirals. Now we know
that the apparently empty spaces in our solar system still
contain a vast number of little meteoric particles, which
as judged from their velocity do not fall from outer space,
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
but are members of our system travelling in their own
orbits around the sun. As he puts it, &ldquo;Could we rise a
hundred miles above the Earth&rsquo;s surface we should be
highly sorry we came, for we should incontinently be
killed by flying brickbats. Instead of masses of a sunlike
size we should have to do with bits of matter on the average
smaller than ourselves<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> but hardly on that account
innocuous, as they would strike us with fifteen hundred
times the speed of an express train.&rdquo; That these meteorites
are moving in the same direction as the Earth he
shows by an ingenious calculation of the proportion that
in such a case would be seen at sunrise and sunset, which
accords with the observed facts. Moreover, their chemical
composition shows that they were once parts of a great hot
body from which they have been expelled.</p>
<p>The meteorites that are seen because they become hot and
luminous in traversing our atmosphere, and occasionally
fall upon the Earth, are the remnants of vastly larger numbers
formerly circling about the sun, but which, by collision
and attraction, were, as he describes, gathered into
great masses, thus forming the planets. The force of gravity
gradually compacted these fragments closer and closer
together, thereby generating heat which if the body were
homogeneous would be in proportion to the square of its
mass. The larger the planet therefore the more heat it
would generate, and owing to the fact that mass is in proportion
to the cube and its radiating surface to the square
of the diameter the slower it would radiate, and thus lose,
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
its heat, so that the larger ones would be hotter and remain
hot longer than the smaller ones.</p>
<p>Some of the planets may once have been white-hot, and
luminous of themselves, some were certainly red-hot, some
only darkly warm; all growing cooler after the amount
radiated exceeded the amount generated. Now by the difference
in the heat generated and retained by the larger
and smaller bodies he explains the diverse appearance of
those whose surfaces we know, the Earth, Mars and the
Moon. As the surface cools it forms a crust, but if the interior
still remains molten it will continue to contract, the
crust will be too large for it and crinkle, like the skin of
a dried apple; and this will be more true of a large than a
small body. &ldquo;In like manner is volcanic action relatively
increased, and volcanoes arise, violent and widespread, in
proportion; since these are vents by which the molten matter
under pressure within finds exit abroad.&rdquo; By a calculation,
which agrees with the formula of Laplace, he finds
that the effective internal heat of the Earth might be 10,000
degrees Fahrenheit, enough to account for all the phenomena;
and for Mars only 2,000, which is below the melting
point of iron, and would not cause volcanic action. Now
the observations of Mars at Flagstaff show that there can
be no mountains on it more than two or three thousand feet
high, and that the surface is singularly flat.</p>
<p>But here he met a difficulty; for the Moon ought to be
flatter still if it had evolved in the ordinary way, whereas
it has enormous volcanic cones, craters 17,000 feet high,
some exceeding 100 miles in diameter, and a range of mountains
rising to nearly 30,000 feet. An explanation he finds
in the analysis of the action of the tides in the Earth-Moon
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
system by Sir George Darwin, who showed that when traced
backward it &ldquo;lands us at a time when the Moon might have
formed a part of the Earth&rsquo;s mass, the two rotating together
as a single pear-shaped body in about five hours.... For
in that event the internal heat which the Moon carried away
with it must have been that of the parent body&mdash;the amount
the Earth-Moon had been able to amass. Thus the Moon
was endowed from the start of its separate existence with
an amount of heat the falling together of its own mass could
never have generated. Thus its great craters and huge volcanic
cones stand explained. It did not originate as a separate
body, but had its birth in a rib of Earth.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></p>
<p>The Flagstaff site having been selected for the purpose of
planetary observation yielded facts less easily detected elsewhere.
Mercury, for instance, is so near the Sun that it
could be observed in the dark only a short time after sunset
and before sunrise, an obstacle that gave rise to errors
of fact. Schiaparelli led the way to better results by observing
this planet in broad daylight. Up to that time it had
been supposed to rotate on its axis in about twenty-four
hours, and therefore to have a day and night like those of
the Earth, but daylight observation showed him markings
constant on its illuminated face, and therefore that it turns
nearly the same side to the Sun. Before knowing his conclusions,
and therefore independently, the study of Mercury
was taken up at Flagstaff in 1896, and the result was a complete
corroboration of his work. It showed that, as in the
case of the Moon with the Earth, tidal action on the still
partially fluid mass had slowed its rotation until it has little
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
with regard to the central body around which it revolves.
He discovered also other facts about Mercury, which Schiaparelli
had not, that its size, mass and density had not been
accurately measured.</p>
<p>A similar discovery about the period of rotation had been
made in the case of Venus. For more than two centuries
astronomers had felt sure that this period was just under
twenty-four hours, figured, indeed, to the minute. But again
it was Schiaparelli who doubted, and once more by observing
the planet at noon; when he noted that the markings on
the disk did not change from day to day, and concluded
that the same side was always pointed at the Sun. At Flagstaff
in 1896 his observations were verified and the inference
later confirmed by the spectroscope, which was, indeed, first
brought to the Observatory for that purpose. Thus Venus,
which from its distance from the Sun, its size and density,
is most like the Earth, turns out to be in a totally different
condition, one face baked by unending glare, the other
chilled in interstellar night, and as he puts it: &ldquo;To Venus
the Sun stands substantially stock-still in the sky,&mdash; ... No
day, no seasons, practically no year, diversifies existence
or records the flight of time. Monotony eternalized,&mdash;such
is Venus&rsquo; lot.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></p>
<p>On the movements and physical condition of the Earth
it was needless to dwell, and he passed to the asteroids. He
describes how they began to be discovered at the beginning
of the last century by searching for a planet that would fill
a gap in Bode&rsquo;s law. This, a formula of arithmetical progression
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
for the distances of the planets from the Sun, has
proved not to be a law at all, especially since the discovery of
Neptune which is much nearer than the formula required;
but for nearly a century it had a strong influence on astronomic
thought, and the gap in the series between Mars and
Jupiter was searched for the missing link. Two were found,
then two more, about the middle of the last century another,
and then many, smaller and smaller, until by the time Percival
wrote six hundred were known, and their number seems
limitless. Only the four first found, he remarks, exceed a
hundred miles in diameter, the greater part being hardly
over ten or twenty. But here he points out a notable fact,
that they are not evenly distributed throughout this space;
and although massed in a series growing thicker toward
its centre there are many gaps, even close to the centre,
where few or no asteroids are found. Now it is the large
size and attraction of Jupiter by which Percival explains the
presence of asteroids with gaps in their ranks, instead of a
planet, in the space between it and Mars; but we shall
hear much more of this subject when we come to his work
on Saturn&rsquo;s rings and the order in the distribution of the
planets.</p>
<p>Jupiter, he tells us, having a mass 318 times that of the
Earth, and a volume 1400 times as large, is much less dense,
not much more than water, in short still fluid; and as it has
a tremendous spin, rotating in less than ten hours, it is more
oblate than the Earth; that is, the diameter at its equator
is larger in proportion to that from pole to pole. The observations
at Flagstaff brought out some interesting facts: first,
that the dark belts of cloud that surround it are red, looking
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
as if the planet within were still molten;<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> second, that the
bright central belt lies exactly upon its equator, without regard
to, and hence independent of, its tilt toward the Sun,
and that the belts of cloud on each side appear at the planet&rsquo;s
morning just as they left it in the evening. All which shows
that Jupiter&rsquo;s cloud formation is not due to the Sun, but to its
own internal heat, an interpretation of the phenomena that
has a direct bearing on his explanation of the Earth&rsquo;s carboniferous
age.</p>
<p>Saturn is still less dense, even more oblate; but its most
extraordinary feature is of course the rings. Assumed by
the early astronomers to be solid and continuous, they were
later shown to have concentric intervals, and to be composed
of discrete particles. They have usually been supposed
flat, but when the position of the planet was such that they
were seen on edge knots or beads appeared upon them;
and in 1907 these were studied critically at Flagstaff, when
it was found that the shadows of the rings on the planet
were not uniform, but had dark cores; these thicker places
lying on the outer margin of each ring where it came to
one of the intervals. These phenomena he explained in the
same way as the distribution of the intervals among the
asteroids.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
<p>About Uranus and Neptune he tells us in this book little
that was not known, and save for their orbits, masses and
satellites not much was known of their condition. But later,
in 1911, the spectroscope at Flagstaff determined the rotation
period of Uranus, afterwards precisely duplicated at
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
the Lick; and later still the spectral bands in the vast atmosphere
of the giant planets were identified as due to methane,
or marsh, gas.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></p>

<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br />LATER EVOLUTION OF THE PLANETS</h2>
<p>After the planets had been formed through the aggregation
of revolving fragments driven off by the catastrophic
collision from the Sun, and after they had attained their
maximum heat in the process, they began, he says, to
go through six stages:</p>
<p>I. The Sun-Stage, when they were white-hot and gave
out light. This could have been true only of the largest ones
if any.</p>
<p>II. The Molten Stage, when they were still red-hot, but
not enough to give light, in which are now the four great
outer planets.</p>
<p>III. The Solidifying Stage, when a crust formed, and
the surface features of the planet began to assume their
character. Here the science of geology takes its start with
the metamorphic rocks, and it is the dividing line between
the inner, smaller, and the outer, larger, planets.</p>
<p>IV. The Terraqueous Stage, when the surface has become
substantially stable, there are great oceans gradually
diminishing in size, and land gradually increasing. This is
the stage of the sedimentary rocks, the time when the planet
passes from its own supply of heat to dependence upon that
of the sun; the stage when life begins, and the one in which
the Earth is now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>V. The Terrestrial Stage, when the oceans have disappeared,
and water is scarce, the one in which Mars is now.</p>
<p>VI. The Dead Stage, where are already the Moon and
the satellites of other planets.</p>
<p>On the question of the origin of life Percival took the
mechanistic view: &ldquo;Upon the fall of the temperature to the
condensing point of water, occurred another event in the
evolution of our planet, the Earth, and one of great import
to us: life arose. For with the formation of water,
protoplasm (the physical basis of all plants and animals)
first became possible, what may be called the life molecule
then coming into existence. By it, starting in a simple, lowly
way, and growing in complexity with time, all vegetable
and animal forms have since been gradually built up. In
itself the organic molecule is only a more intricate chemical
combination of the same elements of which the inorganic
substances which preceded it are composed.... There is
now no more reason to doubt that plants grew out of chemical
affinity than to doubt that stones did. Spontaneous generation
is as certain as spontaneous variation, of which it is,
in fact, only an expression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Life, he believed, began in the oceans soon after they had
cooled below the boiling point, and spread all over them;
seaweeds and trilobites existed in France, Siberia and the
Argentine, their nearest relatives being now confined to the
tropics; coral reefs, now found only in warm equatorial
seas, have left their traces within eight degrees of the pole.
This looks as if in paleozoic times the oceans were uniformly
warm. The same record he finds in the plants of
the carboniferous age. Gigantic ferns and other cryptogams
grew to an immense size, with vast rapidity and without
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
stopping, for there are no annual rings of growth, no signs
of the effect of seasons, no flowers, and little or no color.
&ldquo;Two attributes of the climate this state of things attests.
First, it was warm everywhere with a warmth probably surpassing
that of the tropics of to-day; and, second, the light
was tempered to a half-light known now only under heavy
clouds. And both these conditions were virtually general
in locality and continuous in time.&rdquo; In the later volume
he adds, to corroborate the general darkness, that many of
the earlier trilobites, who lived in shallow water, were blind,
while others had colossal eyes.</p>
<p>Various theories have been advanced to explain the carboniferous
age, which he reviews, showing why they do not
account for the facts. His own is that while the oceans were
still hot a vast steaming must have gone up from them, forming
clouds of great density that would keep the sun&rsquo;s heat
and light out, and the warmth of the Earth in. &ldquo;In paleozoic
times, then, it was the Earth itself, not the Sun, to which
plant and animal primarily stood beholden for existence.
This gives us a most instructive glimpse into one planetologic
process. To the planet&rsquo;s own internal heat is due the
chief fostering of the beginnings of life upon its surface.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a></p>
<p>But he points out that a time must have come when the
Earth, and especially its seas, had cooled, the envelope of
dense cloud had gradually been pierced, and the sun&rsquo;s rays
let in. Then began the sharp alternation of day and night,
the changes in the seasons and the diversity of climates, when
the palms descended to the tropics, and the flora and fauna
as we know them started to develop. This is the period
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
when the Sun was dominant, or the Sun-Sustained Stage,
the one in which we live.</p>
<p>Later the Earth went through another experience of
which the facts are well known, but the date and cause have
puzzled astronomers and geologists alike, for it lies in the
twilight zone between the regions they illuminate. It is the
Glacial Periods. He discusses the theory of Croll, once largely
accepted but now abandoned, that these periods were due
to a change in the eccentricity of the Earth&rsquo;s orbit, combined
with a progression of the equinoxes, which so altered the seasons
that the northern hemisphere would have summers hot
but too short to melt the snow and ice accumulated in the
long cold winters. In fact Percival had already reviewed this
theory some years before in a paper presented to the American
Philosophic Society (Proc. Vol. XXXIX, No. 164) in
which he showed that the eccentricity and inclination of
axis in Mars are very close to those Croll had attributed
to the Earth, and yet a glacial period does not exist there.
In the case of Mars it is the southern hemisphere that should
be glaciated, but in fact, although that pole has the larger
extent of snow in winter this sometimes disappears wholly
in the summer, which is never true at the northern pole.
If, indeed, the amount of ice formed were much larger it
would not be melted, so that the amount of water falling
and frozen, and not the eccentricity or inclination of the
axis, would be the cause of an ice age.</p>
<p>But he had another reason for rejecting Croll&rsquo;s theory,
and, indeed, for disbelieving in a general ice age altogether.
It was that the glaciation does not appear to proceed from
the pole, but from various distinct centres, moving from
them in all directions, north as well as south; while some
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
places, like northern Siberia, that one would expect to be
covered with ice, were not so covered. Nor was the greater
cold confined to the northern hemisphere, for on some
mountains at the equator, and even at the south pole, there
was more ice and snow than there is to-day. His explanation
is that certain parts of the Earth&rsquo;s surface were for some
reason raised higher than they are now; and from the snow
mountains or plateaus so formed the sheets of ice flowed
down.</p>
<p>The remainder of the book on &ldquo;Mars as the Abode of
Life&rdquo;&mdash;and it is the larger part of it&mdash;contains the reasons
for believing that Mars is inhabited, the canals artificial,
and that the Earth will in like manner gradually lose its
supply of water. But this argument need not be retraced
here, because with it the reader has already been made familiar.
&ldquo;The Evolution of Worlds&rdquo; ends with a chapter
entitled &ldquo;Death of a World&rdquo;; for to him the whole theory
of planetary evolution is a vast drama, albeit with a tragic
close. He describes four ways in which a planet, and all life
thereon, may be destroyed. Three of these are: the effect of
tidal action that would bring the same face always toward
the Sun; the loss of water and atmosphere; and the cooling
and final extinction of the Sun. All these things he cheerfully
reminds us are sure to happen, but at a time enormously
distant. The other is a collision with a star&mdash;&ldquo;That
any of the lucent stars, the stars commonly so called, could
collide with the Sun, or come near enough to amount to
the same thing, is demonstrably impossible for aeons of
years. But this is far from the case for a dark star. Such a
body might well be within a hundredth of the distance of
the nearest of our known neighbors.... Our senses could
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
only be cognizant of its proximity by the borrowed light
it reflected from our own Sun.&rdquo; A collision of this kind
might happen at any time, but he consoles us by saying that
&ldquo;judged by any scale of time we know, the chance of such
occurrence is immeasurably remote.&rdquo; In an earlier part of
the book he describes what its advent would be:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can calculate how much warning we should have
of the coming catastrophe. The Sun with its retinue is speeding
through space at the rate of eleven miles a second
toward a point near the bright star Vega. Since the tramp
would probably also be in motion with a speed comparable
with our own, it might hit us coming from any point in
space, the likelihood depending upon the direction and
amount of its own speed. So that at the present moment such
a body may be in any part of the sky. But the chances are
greatest if it be coming from the direction toward which
the Sun is travelling, since it would then be approaching
us head on. If it were travelling itself as fast as the Sun,
its relative speed of approach would be twenty-two miles
a second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The previousness of the warning would depend upon the
stranger&rsquo;s size. The warning would be long according as
the stranger was large. Let us assume it the mass of the
Sun, a most probable supposition. Being dark, it must have
cooled to a solid, and its density therefore be much greater
than the Sun&rsquo;s, probably something like eight times as great,
giving it a diameter about half his or four hundred and
thirty thousand miles. Its apparent brightness would depend
both upon its distance and upon its intrinsic brightness
or albedo, and this last would itself vary according to
its distance from the Sun.... We shall assume, therefore,
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
that its brilliancy would be only that of the Moon,
remembering that the last stages of its fateful journey would
be much more resplendently set off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With these data we can find how long it would be visible
before the collision occurred. As a very small telescopic
star it would undoubtedly escape detection. It is not likely
that the stranger would be noticed simply from its appearance
until it had attained the eleventh magnitude. It would
then be one hundred and forty-nine astronomical units from
the Sun or at five times the distance of Neptune. But its
detection would come about not through the eye of the
body, but through the eye of the mind. Long before it could
have attracted man&rsquo;s attention to itself directly its effects
would have betrayed it. Previous, indeed, to its possible
showing in any telescope the behavior of the outer planets
of the system would have revealed its presence. The far
plummet of man&rsquo;s analysis would have sounded the cause
of their disturbance and pointed out the point from which
that disturbance came. Celestial mechanics would have
foretold, as once the discovery of another planet, so now
the end of the world. Unexplained perturbations in the
motions of the planets, the far tremors of its coming, would
have spoken to astronomers as the first heralding of the
stranger and of the destruction it was about to bring. Neptune
and Uranus would begin to deviate from their prescribed
paths in a manner not to be accounted for except
by the action of some new force. Their perturbations would
resemble those caused by an unknown exterior planet, but
with this difference that the period of the disturbance would
be exactly that of the disturbed planet&rsquo;s own period of revolution
round the Sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our exterior sentinels might fail thus to give us warning
of the foreign body because of being at the time in the
opposite parts of their orbits. We should then be first
apprised of its coming by Saturn, which would give us less
prefatory notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be some twenty-seven years from the time it
entered the range of vision of our present telescopes before
it rose to that of the unarmed eye. It would then have
reached forty-nine astronomical units&rsquo; distance, or two-thirds
as far again as Neptune. From here, however, its
approach would be more rapid. Humanity by this time
would have been made acquainted with its sinister intent
from astronomic calculation, and would watch its slow
gaining in conspicuousness with ever growing alarm. During
the next three years it would have ominously increased
to a first magnitude star, and two years and three months
more have reached the distance of Jupiter and surpassed by
far in lustre Venus at her brightest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile the disturbance occasioned not simply in
the outer planets but in our own Earth would have become
very alarming indeed. The seasons would have been already
greatly changed, and the year itself lengthened, and all
these changes fraught with danger to everything upon the
Earth&rsquo;s face would momentarily grow worse. In one hundred
and forty-five days from the time it passed the distance
of Jupiter it would reach the distance of the Earth.
Coming from Vega, it would not hit the Earth or any of the
outer planets, as the Sun&rsquo;s way is inclined to the planetary
planes by some sixty degrees, but the effects would be none
the less marked for that. Day and night alone of our astronomic
relations would remain. It would be like going mad
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
and yet remaining conscious of the fact. Instead of following
the Sun we should now in whole or part, according to
the direction of its approach, obey the stranger. For nineteen
more days this frightful chaos would continue; as like
some comet glorified a thousand fold the tramp dropped
silently upon the Sun. Toward the close of the nineteenth
day the catastrophe would occur, and almost in merciful
deliverance from the already chaotic cataclysm and the yet
greater horror of its contemplation, we should know no
more.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br />INTERLUDES</h2>
<p>Naturally Percival&rsquo;s observations of Mars, and still more
the conclusions he drew from them, provoked widespread
attention among astronomers, some of whom were convinced,
while some withheld judgment and others were
very frankly disbelievers. This did not amaze him, for he
felt that new ideas made their way slowly, and had always
done so. He met objections, argued his case and expected
ultimate acceptance of his views. Perhaps not less naturally
the popular interest was also great. Newspapers as well as
periodicals all over America, in England, France, Germany
and other countries, published and discussed his views,
especially, of course, on the existence of intelligent beings
on Mars and their artificial canals upon its surface. Marconi
was reported as saying that within a few years we
should be in wireless communication with them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his life had been going on at the usual furious
pace; lecturing here and there; writing for scientific journals,
mostly, but not wholly, on planets, satellites etc.; managing
his own property and his father&rsquo;s estate; keeping in
constant touch with his computers in Boston and his observers
at Flagstaff, worrying over the health of one of
them whom he urges to take a vacation and recruit; and
also standing his watch as observer himself. A watch it was,
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
&ldquo;Jupiter before dinner and Mars at 4 <span class="small">A.M.</span>&rdquo; There was also
a large correspondence with astronomers and others who
were interested in his work. To one of the latter he writes
on December 14, 1907: &ldquo;In answer to your note of Dec. 5,
which has been forwarded to me here, I beg to say that
the best and final education must always be given by one&rsquo;s
self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the canals had already been photographed,
he was not yet free from the doubters of the actuality of
his observations, for on May 15th of that year we find him
writing to Professor Simon Newcomb&mdash;then at the height
of his great reputation who had suggested that the comparative
continuity of the canals was an optical illusion,
a long letter giving the reasons for believing that this could
not be so, but that they must be as observed.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> The proof of
this he was seeking to make more clear, and in this same year
he sent Dr. Slipher, with Professor Todd of Amherst College,
on an expedition to the Andes to take more photographs
of Mars, which appeared in the <i>Century</i> for December.</p>
<p>But it was not all work. The hospitality of the Observatory
was kept up; visiting astronomers and friends lent
a gayety to the place. Mr. George Agassiz, for example,
long his friend in many labors, was there for many months
in 1907 and 1909, helping greatly in his observations;<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> the
late Professor Edward S. Morse at sundry times, and Professor
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
Robert W. Willson in 1909 and 1914. He was also
in kindly relations with his neighbors, who were &ldquo;courteous
enough to ask me to talk, and I am deep in addresses.&rdquo; In
fact some of them were constantly urging him to stand for
Senator from the State. He was interested also in children,
and in March, 1908, he is sending word to Dr. Slipher about
a little girl from Texas eight years old who is to pass through
Flagstaff, and asks permission to look through his big telescope
as she &ldquo;just loves astronomy.&rdquo; He was fond of telling
about his meeting a negro tending chickens to whom he
suggested keeping a watch on them the next day because
they would go to roost about eleven o&rsquo;clock; and they did,
for there was an eclipse of the sun. Some days later he met
the negro again, who expressed astonishment at his knowing
in advance that the chickens would go to roost, and
asked if he had known it a week before. Yes, he had known
it then. &ldquo;Did you know it a month before?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I knew
it a month before.&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you know it a year before?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,
I knew it a year before.&rdquo; &ldquo;But those chickens weren&rsquo;t born
then!&rdquo; Had he lived to the present day he might have discovered
a resemblance to some tendencies in ideas about
the present depression.</p>
<p>Nor were his thoughts confined to this country, for in
August, 1905, he writes to a friend: &ldquo;I go to Japan this autumn,
but how and when I have not yet decided.&rdquo; His old
interest remained, and in April 1908, he arranged an exhibition
in Boston by a Shinto priest of walking over hot coals
and up a ladder of sword blades. &ldquo;The place,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;was full and the audience gratified at being asked. While
in the distance people outside the pale stood on carts and
boys even to the tops of far off houses, one perched on
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
the tip of a chimney. Dr. Suga cut himself slightly but
not seriously. He did very well considering, though it was
not possible of course for a poor lone priest to come up to
what he might have done in Japan. The rite was beautifully
set forth and the setting of the whole enclosure worthy
the most artistic people in the world. Policemen kept out
the crowd and stared aghast, and altogether it was a relished
function.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He probably would have been greatly grieved had he been
told that he would never revisit the land where he had spent
so much of his earlier life and thought; but astronomy was
now his dominant occupation, and was constantly presenting
new questions to engross his attention and fill his time.
Yet in the years when Mars was not in opposition this did
not prevent, indeed it rather stimulated, visits to Europe,
where he saw his astronomical friends, and lectured on his
discoveries; for he was a member of the National Astronomic
Societies of France and Germany, had received from
the former in 1904 the Janssen medal for his researches on
Mars, and in 1907 Mr. Lampland that of the Royal Photographic
Society of Great Britain for the work on the planets.
We find him across the ocean in the summer of 1906,
lunching with Sir Robert Ball in Cambridge, Deslandres
and Flammarion in Paris, and &ldquo;pegging away&rdquo; there at his
lectures.</p>
<p>Two years later, on June 10, 1908, he married Miss Constance
Savage Keith, and they went abroad at the end of
the month. When in London they met his first cousin,
A. Lawrence Rotch, the meteorologist, who like him had
established and directed, at his own expense, an observatory
for the study of his subject; in this case on Blue Hill near
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
Boston. Percival wanted to photograph measurable lines
to see how they appeared in a camera from the air. So he
went up with his cousin in a balloon, and obtained photographs
of the paths in Hyde Park which came out very well.
His wife also went up with them; and, what with his reputation,
the ascent in a balloon and their recent marriage, the
event was too much for a reporter to resist; and there appeared
in a newspaper an imaginary picture of an astronomer
and a bride in a wedding dress taking their honeymoon
in the basket of a balloon. They travelled together in England,
Switzerland, Germany and France, and she recalls,
when he was giving a lecture at the Sorbonne, a sudden exclamation
from a Frenchman directly behind her: &ldquo;Why!
He is even clever in French!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Lowell has written an account of the diligence, the
enthusiasm, the hardships of Percival and his colleagues,
and the spirit of Flagstaff:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In October, soon after our return from Europe, I discovered
that the scientist&rsquo;s motto is&mdash;&ldquo;Time is sacred.&rdquo; I
was to meet him on the train for Flagstaff leaving the South
Station at 2 <span class="small">P.M.</span>; anxious to impress him with my reputation
for being punctual, I boarded the train about ten minutes
before two. Percival came into the car, holding his watch
in his hand, just about two minutes before two. He turned
to me: &ldquo;What time were you here?&rdquo; I answered triumphantly:
&ldquo;Oh, I got here about ten minutes ago.&rdquo; His reply
was: &ldquo;I consider that just as unpunctual as to be late. Think
how much could have been accomplished in ten minutes!&rdquo;
I have never forgotten that remark. Percival never wasted
minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late in the afternoon of the third day, as we were nearing
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
Flagstaff, through the dusk we could see that there had
been a heavy fall of snow, so deep that when the train
stopped our Pullman, being far in the rear, was where the
snow&mdash;not having been shovelled&mdash;was almost level with
the upper step. The men from the Observatory were there,
and their first words were &lsquo;Seeing Good.&rsquo; Percival jumped
into the deep snow, and taking Mr. E. C. Slipher with him,
drove to the telescope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Astronomers take much for granted so far as the details
of domestic life are concerned, and I made up my mind
to be a help and not a hindrance. Dr. V. M. Slipher&rsquo;s wife
came to the rescue, and under her supervision things were
soon adjusted even to a hot supper and preparation for
breakfast the next morning. She was, and always is, a
wonder. Though the wife be not an astronomer a happy
asset is it if she can appreciate her husband&rsquo;s work, his sacrifices
and self-denials. Many times have I seen their frost-bitten
ears and thumbs; hungry and tired men, but never
complaining&mdash;patience personified. They are slaves to the
laws that rule the celestial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house we lived in on Mars Hill was a long rambling
one, both roof and sides shingled. Inside all but two rooms
were finished, and partitioned. Two were papered; one of
them I papered because no paper hanger happened to be
in town. Occasionally Percival would come in to see how
the work was progressing, and help by steadying the ladder
or stirring the paste. The sitting room&mdash;or den, as it was
referred to more often&mdash;was lined with half logs from which
the bark had not been stripped. In the ceiling were logs
used as beams. During the evening, when all was quiet,
one might hear insects busily working out some scheme of
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
their own. Open spaces were beamed and, as the logs did
not exactly fit, through the spaces trade-rats would descend
from the attic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To love nature, and the one for whom one works, it matters
not where one is; that is what one realizes when on
Mars Hill. One learns to go without things. They seem
of such minor importance to that for which the men are
seeking; one gets ashamed of oneself to think otherwise.
Each man moves with a definite purpose, indefatigable
workers, no thought of themselves when skies are clear, always
watching, cold or torrid heat makes no difference,
work goes on just the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I became deeply impressed with the necessity of obedience
to laws. I said once to Percival that I had been asked
if it were true that he was an atheist, a non-believer. His
answer was that he believed in keeping the laws; what chaos
would happen if they were not. Often he would quote
passages from the Bible&mdash;[Genesis I, 14-20]. The laws made
on Mount Sinai, he said, are still the same laws to obey.
To live in the atmosphere of such men accomplishing great
things, deprived of many material comforts, makes one feel
humble and spurs one on to &lsquo;Help and not to hinder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Servants we often had to do without. They would
come out with us, and then after a few days, learning of
the nearness to the Pacific coast, the lure of California would
bring from them some lame excuse to leave, at once! To
obtain others, when none were to be had in the town, I
would have to go to Los Angeles. Finally, after several had
left, I persuaded Percival to let me try to do the cooking;
and later he would refer to that time as happy peaceful days.
With the help of the kind wives, Mrs. Slipher and Mrs.
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
Lampland, I learned much, how to make bread and soup,&mdash;two
very essential articles in our household,&mdash;and to get up
camping outfits and quick meals for unexpected guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lonesome, monotonous&mdash;never. Distant as Mars Hill
may be from large cities, something of interest was happening
continually. The State Normal School of Arizona is
in the town, and on certain nights classes of students were
brought up the hill to look through the telescope. Flagstaff
is on the main line of the Santa Fe. There were three
incoming trains from the East each day, and as many from
the West, and many people stop off there to visit the different
points of interest, the Lowell Observatory being one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In August, 1910, a group of astronomers, representing
the International Union for Co&ouml;peration in Solar Research,
debarked from the train, on their way to Pasadena; Professor
Herbert H. Turner from England among them. He it was
who many years later suggested for Percival&rsquo;s &lsquo;Planet X&rsquo;
the name Pluto. The group, of about thirty, arrived by the
first morning train and stayed at the Observatory until
the last train left at night. The one thing that I was successful
in getting enough of for lunch and dinner was watermelon.
It proved a happy hit; for a year or two afterward,
when telling how much they enjoyed their visit, the watermelons
were spoken of as being such a treat. It was a hot
day and the melons were cold; probably that explained their
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One Christmas we invited all the children of Flagstaff
to come to the Observatory for a Christmas tree and supper.
Percival dressed as Santa Claus and spoke to them
down the chimney; then he came down into the Library
where they were gathered about the tree, and gave a present
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
and candy to every child. That was twenty-seven years ago.
When I was in Flagstaff this spring, the little child I had
held in my lap while Percival read &lsquo;The Night Before
Christmas&rsquo; came to speak to me and told me never would
she forget that Christmas, and that her two little children
repeatedly asked her to tell them the story of that Christmas
and all that happened at the Santa Claus party on
Mars Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a recent letter to Mrs. Lowell, Dr. Lampland also
gives a glimpse into Percival&rsquo;s life at Flagstaff; and though
written to refresh her recollections she preferred to insert
it as it stands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fresh in memory and pleasant to recall are your many
visits to Flagstaff and your activities at the Observatory,
where you were designing and supervising architect, carrying
through the additions to the director&rsquo;s residence, the
garage, and the new administration building. And I also
remember your valued help to us in connection with the
house in which we live and your telegram &lsquo;Mr. Lowell
gives benediction and sanction to plans. Proceed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then goes on to tell of Percival&rsquo;s friends from both
West and East, and continues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember he was an enthusiastic gardener and
always had a garden here at the Observatory. He had great
success with many flowers and I recall especially fine displays
of hollyhocks, zinnias, and a considerable variety of
bulbs. Gourds, squashes and pumpkins were also great
favorites. You will remember one year the especially fine
collection of gourds and that bumper crop of huge pumpkins,
many prize specimens being sugar fed. At times Dr.
Lowell could be seen in the short intervals he took for
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
outdoor recreation, busy with his little camel&rsquo;s hair brush
pollenizing some of the flowers. And perhaps you will
remember the little record book lying on the back veranda
containing his observations of the daily growth of the diameter
of the gourds, all measured carefully with little
calipers. Then the frequent, almost daily, walks on the
mesa. Certainly he knew all the surrounding country better
than anyone here. He would refer to the different places
such as Wolf Canyon, Amphitheatre Canyon, Indian Paint
Brush Ridge, Holly Ravine, Mullein Patch, etc. In these
walks he seemed to be constantly observing something new
and of course trees, flowers, and wild life always interested
him. Trees were an endless source of interest to him and
he took many trips to more distant localities for these
studies. Cedars or junipers seemed to be favorite subjects
for study, though other varieties or kinds were not overlooked.
An oak and an ash were named after him, new
species that were discovered on the Observatory mesa
and in Sycamore Canyon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At every season of the year he always found something
in wild life to fascinate him, and you will remember his
observations and notes of butterflies, birds, squirrels, rabbits,
coyotes, deer and other inhabitants of the mesa. These
friends must never be disturbed or harmed. But it was
permissible to hunt with a camera! And he himself delighted
with his kodak, photographing footprints, etc., and
often attempting to get exposures of the creatures themselves.
The Observatory grounds were a sanctuary for wild
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For many of us an interesting side of eminent personages
is to know something about their activities, such for example
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
as reading, outside of their professional occupations. In
Dr. Lowell&rsquo;s case you should find ample opportunity to
treat a subject that will not admit of monotony. It would
seem that practically every field of knowledge interested
him. For the lighter reading as a relaxing and restful diversion
you will remember the full bookshelves of detective
stories, travel, exploration, etc. Accounts of adventure and
discoveries, if well written, were welcome to his list of miscellaneous
reading. The Latin classics were always near
at hand, and widely and well had he read them, and much
were they prized as friends in his later life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you know, it is not easy for the observing astronomer
to lead a strictly regular life in that the hours at the telescope
often make it necessary to use, for the much needed
rest, part of the daily hours usually given to work. His
intense occupation with his research problems, however, was
broken with great regularity for short intervals before lunch
and dinner. These times of recreation were given to walks
on the mesa or work in the garden. When night came, if
he was not occupied at the telescope, he was generally to
be found in his den. It was not always possible for him to
lay aside his research problems at this time of the day,
but he did have some wholesome views on the necessity of
recreation and a necessary amount of leisure to prevent a
person from falling into the habit of the &lsquo;grind.&rsquo; To those
who came to his den the picture of some difficult technical
work near his chair, such as Tisserand&rsquo;s <i>Mechanique Celeste</i>
will be recalled, though he might at the time be occupied
with reading of a lighter character. And occasionally during
the evening he might be seen consulting certain difficult
parts upon which he was pondering....</p>

<p>&ldquo;The famous outing to the White Mountains was often
the subject of much amusement at the dinner parties when
Dr. Lowell and Judge Doe were both there. In later years
that famous expedition seemed to be an inexhaustible source
of fun&mdash;the voracious mosquitoes, the discomforts of a camp
and beds under water, atrocious coffee, and so on!!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this reminds me of many dinner parties on Dr.
Lowell&rsquo;s and Judge Doe&rsquo;s birthdays. These were jolly
gatherings, and the brilliant repartee passing between Dr.
Lowell and the Judge was a great delight to those who were
present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many things about the place often remind me of the intensely
busy days before Dr. Lowell passed away. There
were several excursions for his tree studies, to Sycamore
Canyon, an arduous trip, and to other localities near Flagstaff
for further studies of different species of junipers in
their native habitat. The specimens were carefully sorted
and packed for Professor Sargent of the Arnold Arboretum.
Then I remember helping him plant many bulbs on
the last two days before he was fatally stricken. The squills
he planted at that time in the little bed under the oak tree
near the entrance of the B. M. return every spring.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a></p>

<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br />THE EFFECT OF COMMENSURATE PERIODS
<br /><span class="sc">The Asteroids and Saturn&rsquo;s Rings</span></h2>
<p>Ever inquiring, ever fertile, his mind turned to seek the
explanation of divers astronomical phenomena. In 1912,
for example, under the title &ldquo;Precession and the Pyramids,&rdquo;
we find him discussing in the <i>Popular Science Monthly</i> the
pyramid of Cheops as an astronomical observatory, with its
relation to the position of the star then nearest to the North
Pole, its lines of light and shadow, in a great gallery constructed
with the object of recording the exact changes in
the seasons.</p>
<p>But leaving aside these lesser interests, and the unbroken
systematic observation of the planets, his attention in the
later years of his life was chiefly occupied by two subjects,
not unconnected, but which may be described separately.
They are, first, the influence over each other&rsquo;s position and
orbits of two bodies, both revolving about a far larger one;
and, second, the search for an outer planet beyond the path
of Neptune. Each of these studies involved the use of
mathematics with expanding series of equations which no
one had better attempt to follow unless he is fresh and
fluent in such forms of expression. For accurate and quantitative
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
results they are absolutely essential, but an impression
of what he was striving to do may be given without
them.</p>
<p>Two bodies revolving about a common centre at different
distances, and therefore different rates of revolution, will
sometimes be on the same side of the central body, and thus
nearer together; sometimes on opposite sides, when they
will be much farther apart. Now it is clear that the attraction
of gravity, being inversely as the square of the distance,
will be greatest when they are nearest together; and if this
happens at the same point in their orbits every time they
approach each other the effect will be cumulative, and in
the aggregate much larger than if they approach at different
parts of their orbits and hence pull each other sometimes in
one direction and sometimes in another. To use a homely,
and not altogether apt, illustration: If a man, starting from
his front door, walk every day across his front lawn in the
same track he will soon make a beaten path and wear the
grass away. If, instead, he walk by this path only every
other day and on the alternate days by another, he will
make two paths, neither of which will be so much worn.
If he walk by three tracks in succession the paths will be
still less worn; and if he never walk twice in the same place
the effect on the grass will be imperceptible.</p>
<p>Now, if the period taken by the outer body to complete
its orbit be just twice as long as that taken by the inner,
they will not come close together again until the outer one
has gone round once to the inner one&rsquo;s twice, and they will
always approach at the same point in their orbits. Hence
the effects on each other will be greatest. If the outer one
take just two turns while the inner takes three they will
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
approach again only at the same point, but less frequently;
so that the pull will be always the same, but repeated less
often. This will be clearly true whenever the rates of the
revolution differ by unity: <i>e.g.</i>, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5,
etc.</p>
<p>Take another case where the periods differ by two; for
example, where the inner body revolves about the central
one three times while the outer one does so once; in that
case the inner one will catch up with the outer when
the latter has completed half a revolution and the inner one
and a half; and again when the outer has completed one
whole revolution and the inner three. In this case there
will be two strong pulls on opposite sides of the orbits, and,
as these pulls are not the same, the total effect will be less
than if there were only one pull in one direction. This
is true whenever the periods of revolution differ by two, <i>e.g.</i>,
1 to 3, 3 to 5, 5 to 7. If the periods differ by three the two
bodies will approach three times,&mdash;once at the starting point,
then one third way round, and again two thirds way round,
before they reach the starting point; three different pulls
clearly less effective.</p>
<p>In cases like these, where the two bodies approach in only
a limited number of places in their orbits the two periods
of revolution are called commensurate, because their ratio
is expressed by a simple fraction. The effect is greater as
the number of such places in the orbit is less, and as the
number of revolutions before they approach is less. But
it is clearly greater than when the two bodies approach
always at different places in their orbits, never again where
they have done so before. This is when the two periods
are incommensurate, so that their ratio cannot be expressed
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
by any vulgar fraction. One other point must be noticed.
The commensurate orbit, and hence the distance from the
Sun, and the period of revolution, of the smaller and therefore
most affected body, may not be far from a distance where
the orbits would be incommensurate. To take the most completely
incommensurate ratio known to science, that of the
diameter of a circle to the circumference, which has been
carried out to seven hundred decimal places without repetition
of the figures. This is expressed by the decimal fraction
.314159 etc. and yet this differs from the simple commensurate
1/3 or .333333 etc. by only about five per cent.; so that
a smaller body may have to be pulled by the larger, only
a very short way before it reaches a point where it will be
seriously affected no more.</p>
<p>The idea that commensurateness affects the mutual attraction
of bodies, and hence the perturbations in their orbits,
especially of the smaller one, was not new; but Percival
carried it farther, and to a greater degree of accuracy, by
observation, by mathematics and in its applications. The
most obvious example of its effects lay in the influence of
Jupiter upon the distribution of the asteroids, that almost
innumerable collection of small bodies revolving about the
Sun between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars, of which some
six hundred had been discovered. These are so small, compared
with Jupiter, that, not only individually but in the
aggregate, their influence upon it may be disregarded, and
only its effect upon them be considered. In its immediate
neighborhood the commensurate periods, Percival points
out, come so close together (100 to 101, 99 to 100, etc.) that
although occasions of approach would be infrequent they
would be enough in time to disturb any bodies so near,
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
until the planet had cleared out everything in its vicinity
that did not, by revolving around it, become its own satellite.</p>
<p>Farther off Jupiter&rsquo;s commensurate zones are less frequent,
but where they occur the fragments revolving about
the Sun would be so perturbed by the attraction of the planet
as to be displaced, mainly, as Percival points out, to the
sunward side. This has made gaps bare of such fragments,
and between them incommensurate spaces where they could
move freely in their solar orbits. Here they might have
gathered in a nucleus and, collecting other fragments to it,
form a small planet, were it not that the gaps were frequent
enough to prevent nuclei of sufficient size arising anywhere.
Thus the asteroids remained a host of little bodies revolving
about the Sun, with gaps in their ranks&mdash;as he puts it &ldquo;embryos
of planets destined never to be born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <a href="#fig8">upper diagram</a> in the plate opposite <a href="#Page_166">page 166</a> shows
the distribution and relative densities of the asteroids, with
the gaps at the commensurate points. The plate is taken
from his &ldquo;Memoir on Saturn&rsquo;s Rings,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> and brings us to
another study of commensurate periods with quite a different
set of bodies obeying the same law. Indeed, among the
planets observed at Flagstaff not the least interesting was
Saturn, and its greatest peculiarity was its rings.</p>
<p>In Bulletin No. 32 of the Observatory (Nov. 24, 1907)
Percival had written: &ldquo;Laplace first showed that the rings
could not be, as they appear, wide solid rings inasmuch as the
strains due to the differing attraction of Saturn for the several
parts must disrupt them. Peirce then proved that even
a series of very narrow solid rings could not subsist and that
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
the rings must be fluid. Finally Clerk-Maxwell showed that
even this was not enough and that the rings to be stable must
be made up of discrete particles, a swarm of meteorites in
fact. But, if my memory serves me right, Clerk-Maxwell
himself pointed out that even such a system could not
eternally endure but was bound eventually to be forced both
out and in, a part falling upon the surface of the planet, a
part going to form a satellite farther away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even before this Edward Roche in 1848 had shown that
the rings must be composed of discrete particles, mere dust
and ashes. He drew this conclusion from his investigations
on the minimum distance at which a fluid satellite could revolve
around its primary without being disrupted by tidal
strains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dissolution which Clerk-Maxwell foresaw can easily
be proved to be inevitable if the particles composing the
swarm are not at considerable distances from one another,
which is certainly not the case with the rings as witnessed
by the light they send us even allowing for their comminuted
form. For a swarm of particles thus revolving round a
primary are in stable equilibrium <i>only in the absence of
collisions</i>. Now in a crowded company collisions due either
to the mutual pulls of the particles or to the perturbations of
the satellites must occur. At each collision although the
moment of momentum remains the same, energy is lost
unless the bodies be perfectly elastic, a condition not found
in nature, the lost energy being converted into heat. In consequence
some particles will be forced in toward the planet
while others are driven out and eventually the ring system
disappears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the interest of the observations at Flagstaff consists
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
in their showing us this disintegration in process of taking
place and furthermore in a way that brings before us an interesting
case of celestial mechanics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He examines the rings mathematically, as the result of
perturbations caused by the two nearest of the planet&rsquo;s
satellites, Mimas and Enceladus.</p>
<p>The effect is the same that occurs in the case of Jupiter and
the asteroids, Saturn taking the place of the Sun, his satellites
that of Jupiter, and the rings that of the asteroids. In
spite of repetition it may be well to state in his own words
the principle of commensurate periods and its application to
the rings:<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The same thing can be seen geometrically by considering
that the two bodies have their greatest perturbing effect on
one another when in conjunction and that if the periods of the
two be commensurate they will come to conjunction over and
over in these same points of the orbit and thus the disturbance
produced by one on the other be cumulative. If the periods
are not commensurate the conjunctions will take place in
ever shifting positions and a certain compensation be effected
in the outstanding results. In proportion as the ratio
of periods is simple will the perturbation be potent. Thus
with the ratio 1:2 the two bodies will approach closest only
at one spot and always there until the perturbations induced
themselves destroy the commensurability of period. With
1:3 they will approach at two different spots recurrently;
with 1:4 at three, and so on....</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see, then, that perturbations, which in this case will
result in collisions, must be greatest on those particles which
have periods commensurate with those of the satellites. But
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
inasmuch as there are many particles in any cross-section of
the ring there must be a component of motion in any collision
tending to throw the colliding particles out of the
plane of the ring, either above or below it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering, now, those points where commensurability
exists between the periods of particle and satellite we find
these in the order of their potency:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td>With Mimas, </td><td>1:2</td></tr>
<tr><td> </td><td>1:3</td></tr>
<tr><td> </td><td>1:4</td></tr>
<tr><td>With Enceladus, </td><td>1:3</td></tr>
</table>
<p>2:3 of Mimas and 1:2; 2:3 of Enceladus falling outside
the ring system. 1:2 of Mimas and 1:3 of Enceladus fall in
Cassini&rsquo;s division, which separates ring A from ring B....
1:3 of Mimas&rsquo; period falls at the boundary of ring B and
ring C at 1:50 radii of Saturn from the centre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the following years this supposition was reinforced by
the discovery of six new divisions in the rings. Three of
them were in ring A and three in ring B, two of them in each
case seen by Percival for the first time. This led to very
careful measurements of Saturn&rsquo;s ball and rings in 1913-14
and again in 1915; recorded in Bulletins 66 and 68 of the
Observatory. Careful allowance was made for irradiation,
and the results checked by having two sets of measurements,
one made by Percival, the other by Mr. E. C. Slipher. The
observations were, of course, made when the rings were
so tilted to the Earth as to show very widely, the tilt on
March 21, 1915, showing them at their widest for fifteen
years.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, as it seemed, the divisions in the rings
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
did not come quite where the commensurate ratios with the
two nearest satellites should place them. They came in the
right order and nearly where they ought to be, but always a
little farther from Saturn. It occurred to Percival that this
might be due to an error in the calculation of the motion of
the rings, that if the attraction of Saturn were slightly more
than had been supposed the revolutions of all parts of the
rings would be slightly faster, and the places in them where
the periods would be commensurate with the satellites would
be slightly farther out, that is where the divisions actually
occur. Everyone knows that the earth is not a perfect sphere
but slightly elliptical, or oblate, contracted from pole to pole
and enlarged at the equator; and the same is even more true
of Saturn on account of its greater velocity of rotation. Now
its attraction on bodies as near it as the rings, and to a less
extent on its satellites, is a little greater than it would be if
it were a perfect uniform sphere; and it would be greater
still if it were not uniform throughout, but composed of
layers increasing in density, in rapidity of rotation, and
hence in oblateness, toward the centre. Percival made, therefore,
a highly intricate calculation on what the attraction of
such a body would be (&ldquo;Observatory Memoir on Saturn&rsquo;s
Rings,&rdquo; Sept. 7, 1915), and found that it accounted almost
exactly for the discrepancy between the points of computed
commensurateness and the observed divisions in the rings.
Such a constitution of Saturn is by no means improbable in
view of its still fluid condition and the process of contraction
that it is undergoing. He found it noteworthy that a study
of the perturbations of the rings by the satellites should bring
to light the invisible constitution of the planet itself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small discrepancies are often big with meaning. Just as
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
the more accurate determination of the nitrogen content of
the air led Sir William Ramsay to the discovery of argon;
so these residuals between the computed and the observed
features of <i>Saturn&rsquo;s</i> rings seem to lead to a new conception
of <i>Saturn&rsquo;s</i> internal constitution. That the mere position of
his rings should reveal something within him which we
cannot see may well appear as singular as it is significant.&rdquo;
(p. 5); and he concludes: (pp. 20-22).</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this indicates that <i>Saturn</i> has not yet settled down to
a uniform rotation. Not only in the spots we see is the rate
different for different spots but from this investigation it
would appear that the speed of its spin increases as one sinks
from surface to centre.<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The subject of this memoir is of course two-fold: first,
the observed discrepancy, and second, the theory to account
for it. The former demands explanation and the latter seems
the only way to satisfy it. From the positions of the divisions
in its rings we are thus led to believe that <i>Saturn</i> is actually
rotating in layers with different velocities, the inside ones
turning the faster. If these layers were two only, or substantially
two, this would result in <i>Saturn&rsquo;s</i> being composed
of a very oblate kernel surrounded by a less oblate husk of
cloud.&rdquo;</p>

caused by Enceladus, the rest those caused by Mimas.

<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIIII
<br />THE ORIGIN OF THE PLANETS</h2>
<p>In a paper presented to the American Academy in April,
1913, and printed in their Memoirs<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> Percival explained the
&ldquo;Origin of the Planets&rdquo; by the same principle of commensurate
periods. In addition to what has already been
said about the places where these periods occur coming closer
and closer together as an object nears the planet, so that it is
enabled to draw neighboring small bodies into itself, he
points out that in attracting any object outside of its own
orbit a planet is acting from the same side as the Sun thereby
increasing the Sun&rsquo;s attraction, accelerating the motion of the
particle and making it come sunward. Whereas on a particle
inside its orbit the planet is acting against the Sun, thereby
diminishing its attraction, slowing the motion of the particle
and causing it to move outward. &ldquo;Thus a body already
formed tends to draw surrounding matter to itself by making
that matter&rsquo;s mean motion nearly synchronous with its
own.&rdquo; These two facts, the close&mdash;almost continuous&mdash;commensurate
points, and the effects on the speed of revolution
of particles outside and inside its own orbit, assist a
nucleus once formed to sweep clear the space so far as its
influence is predominant, drawing all matter there to itself,
until it has attained its full size. &ldquo;Any difference of density in
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
a revolving nebula is thus a starting point for accumulation.
So soon as two or three particles have gathered together they
tend by increased mass to annex their neighbors. An embryo
planet is thus formed. By the same principle it grows
crescendo through an ever increasing sphere of influence
until the commensurate points are too far apart to bridge by
their oscillation the space between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much for the process of forming a planet; but what he
was seeking was why the planets formed just where they
did. For this purpose he worked out intricate mathematical
formulae, based on those already known but more fully
and exactly developed. These it is not necessary to follow,
for the results may be set forth,&mdash;so far as possible in his
own words. &ldquo;Beyond a certain distance from the planet the
commensurate-period swings no longer suffice to bridge the
intervening space and the planet&rsquo;s annexing power stops.
This happens somewhat before a certain place is reached
where three potent periodic ratios succeed each other&mdash;1:2,
2:5, 1:3. For here the distances between the periodic
points is greatly increased....</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this distance a new action sets in. Though the character
of its occasioning be the same it produces a very different
outcome. The greater swing of the particles at these
commensurate points together with a temporary massing of
some of them near it conduces to collisions and near approaches
between them which must end in a certain permanent
combining there. A nucleus of consolidation is thus
formed. This attracts other particles to it, gaining force by
what it feeds on, until out of the once diffused mass a new
planet comes into being which in its turn gathers to itself
the matter about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;A new planet tends to collect here: because the annexing
power of the old has here ceased while at the same time the
scattered constituents to compose it are here aided to combine
by the very potent commensurability perturbations of
its already formed neighbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So soon as it has come into being another begins to
be beyond it, called up in the same manner. It could not
do so earlier because the most important <i>deus ex machina</i>
in the matter, the perturbation of its predecessor, was lacking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the process goes on, each planet acting as a sort of
elder sister in bringing up the next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That such must have been the genesis of the several
planets is evident when we consider that had each arisen
of itself out of surrounding matter there would have been
in celestial mechanics nothing to prevent their being situated
in almost any relative positions other than the peculiar one
in which they actually stand....</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be noticed that the several planets are not quite at
the commensurate points. They are in fact all just inside
them.... Suppose now a particle or planet close to the
commensurable point inside it. The mean motion in consequence
of the above perturbation will be permanently increased,
and therefore the major axis be permanently decreased.
In other words, the particle or planet will be pushed
sunward. If it be still where&rdquo; the effect of the commensurateness
is still felt &ldquo;it will suffer another push, and so on until
it has reached a place where the perturbation is no longer
sensible.&rdquo; He then goes on to show from his formulae that
if the particle were just within the outer edge of the place
where the perturbation began to be effective it would also be
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
pushed sunward, and so across the commensurable point
until it joined those previously displaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thus reach from theory two conclusions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. All the planets were originally forced to form where
the important and closely lying commensurable points 1:2,
2:5, or 1:3, and in one case 3:5, existed with their neighbors;
which of these points it was being determined by the
perturbations themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. Each planet was at the same time pushed somewhat
sunward by perturbation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then calculates the mutual perturbations of the major
axes of the outer planets taken in pairs and of Venus and the
Earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From them we note that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. The inner planet is <i>caeteris paribus</i> more potent than
the outer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. The greater the mass of the disturber and, in certain
cases, the greater the excentricity of either the disturber or
the disturbed the greater the effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he points out, the effect of each component of the pair
is masked by the simultaneous action of the other, and refers
to the case of Jupiter and the asteroids, where the effect
they have upon it is imperceptible, and we can see its effect
upon them clearly.</p>
<p>Thus he shows that a new planet would naturally arise
near to a point where its orbit would be commensurate with
that of the older one next to it. But the particular commensurate
fraction in each case is not so certain. In general
it would depend upon the ratio of the two pulls to each other,
for if &ldquo;the action of the more potent planet greatly exceeds
the other&rsquo;s it sweeps to itself particles farther away than
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
would otherwise be possible&rdquo;; if it does not so greatly exceed
it would not sweep them from so far and hence allow
the other planet to form nearer. Now of the four commensurate
ratios mentioned, near which a planet may form
its neighbor, that of 3:5 means that the two planets are
relatively nearest together, for the inner one makes only five
revolutions while the outer makes three, that is the inner
one revolves around the Sun less than twice as fast as the
outer one. The ratio 1:2 means that the inner one revolves
just twice as fast as the outer; while 2:5 means that it revolves
twice and a half as fast, and 1:3 that it does so three
times as fast. Thus the nearer equal the pulls of any pair of
forming planets the larger the fraction and the nearer the
relative distance between them. Relative, mind, for as we
go away from the Sun all the dimensions increase and the
actual distances between the planets among the rest.</p>
<p>Venus is smaller than the Earth, but her interior position
gives her an advantage more than enough to make up for
this, with the result that the pulls of the two are more nearly
equal than those of any other pair, the commensurate ratio
being 3:5. The next nearest equality of pull is between
Uranus and Neptune, where the commensurate ratio is 1:2;
the next between Jupiter and Saturn, and Venus and Mercury,
where it is 2:5; the least equality being between Saturn
and Uranus, where it is only 1:3. Mars seems exceptional
for, as Percival says, from the mutual pulls we should expect
its ratio with the Earth to be 1:3 instead of 1:2 as it is,
and he suggests as the explanation, &ldquo;the continued action of
the gigantic Jupiter in this territory, or it may be that a
second origin of condensation started with the Earth while
Jupiter fashioned the outer planets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>He brings the Memoir to an end with the following summary:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the foregoing some interesting deductions are
possible:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. The planets grew out of scattered material. For had
they arisen from already more or less complete nuclei these
could not have borne to one another the general comensurate
relation of mean motions existent to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. Each brought the next one into being by the perturbation
it induced in the scattered material at a definite
distance from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3. Jupiter was the starting point, certainly as regards the
major planets; and is the only one among them that could
have had a nucleus at the start, though that, too, may equally
have been lacking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4. After this was formed Saturn, then Uranus, and then
Neptune.&rdquo; (This he shows from the densities of these
planets.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;5. The asteroids point unmistakably to such a genesis,
missed in the making.</p>
<p>&ldquo;6. The inner planets betray <i>inter se</i> the action of the same
law, and dovetail into the major ones through the 2:5 relation
between Mars and the asteroids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thus close with the law we enunciated: <i>Each planet
has formed the next in the series at one of the adjacent commensurable-period
points, corresponding to 1:2, 2:5, 1:3,
and in one instance 3:5, of its mean motion, each then displacing
the other slightly sunward, thus making of the solar
system an articulated whole, an inorganic organism, which
not only evolved but evolved in a definite order, the steps of
which celestial mechanics enables us to retrace</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;The above planetary law may perhaps be likened to
Mendelief&rsquo;s law for the elements. It, too, admits of prediction.
Thus in conclusion I venture to forecast that when
the nearest trans-Neptunian planet is detected it will be
found to have a major axis of very approximately 47.5 astronomical
units, and from its position a mass comparable
with that of Neptune, though probably less; while, if it
follows a feature of the satellite systems which I have pointed
out elsewhere, its excentricity should be considerable, with an
inclination to match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last paragraph we shall have reason to recall again.</p>
<p>This paper on the &ldquo;Origin of the Planets&rdquo; has been called
the most speculative of Percival&rsquo;s astronomical studies, and
so it is; but it fascinated him, and is interesting not more in
itself, than as an illustration of the inquiring and imaginative
trend of his mind and of the ease with which intricate mathematical
work came to the aid of an idea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his reputation was growing in Europe. At the
end of 1909 he is asked to send to the German National
Museum in Munich some transparencies of his fundamental
work on Mars and other planets with Dr. Slipher&rsquo;s star
spectra, and Dr. Max Wolf of Heidelberg who writes the
letter adds: &ldquo;I believe there is no American astronomer,
except yours, [sic] invited till now to do so.&rdquo; A year later
the firm in Jena which had just published a translation of
his &ldquo;Soul of the Far East&rdquo; wants to do the same for &ldquo;Mars
as the Abode of Life.&rdquo; In August 1914 he writes to authorize
a second French edition of this last book which had been
published with the title &ldquo;Evolution des Mondes.&rdquo; Every
other year, he took a vacation of a few weeks in Europe
to visit his astronomic friends, and to speak at their societies.
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
We have seen how he did so after his marriage in 1908. He
went with Mrs. Lowell again in the spring of 1910, giving
lectures before the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Astronomique in Paris, and the
Royal Institution in London, and once more, two years later,
when we find him entertained and speaking before several
scientific bodies in both Paris and London. That autumn he
was confined to the house by illness; and although he improved
and went to Flagstaff in March, he writes of himself
in August 1913 as &ldquo;personally still on the retired list.&rdquo; In
the spring it was thought wise for him to take another vacation
abroad; and since his wife was recovering from an
operation he went alone. He saw his old friends in France
and England and enjoyed their hospitality; but he did not
feel well, and save for showing at the Bureau des Longitudes
&ldquo;some of our latest discoveries&rdquo; he seems to have made no
addresses. He sailed back on the <i>Mauretania</i> on August 1,
just before England declared war, and four days later she
was instructed to run to Halifax, which she did, reaching
it the following day.</p>
<p>That was destined to be his last voyage, for although he
seemed well again he was working above his strength. His
time in these years was divided between Flagstaff, where his
days and nights were spent in observing and calculating,
and Boston, where the alternative was between calculations
and business. He was always busy and when one summer
he hired a house at Marblehead near to his cousins Mr. and
Mrs. Guy Lowell he would frequently drop in to see them;
and was charming when he did so; but could not spare the
time to take a meal there, and never stayed more than five
minutes.</p>

<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br />THE SEARCH FOR A TRANS-NEPTUNIAN PLANET</h2>
<p>We must now return to the last paragraph of his &ldquo;Memoir
on the Origin of the Planets,&rdquo; where he suggests the probable
distance of a body beyond Neptune. In fact he had long
been interested in its existence and whereabouts. By 1905
his calculations had given him so much encouragement that
the Observatory began to search for the outer planet, which
he then expected would be like Neptune, low in density,
large and bright, and therefore much more easily detected
than it turned out to be. But the photographs taken in 1906,
with a well planned routine search the next year revealed
nothing, and he became distrustful of the data on which he
was working. In March 1908, one finds in his letter-books
from the office in Boston the first of a series of letters to Mr.
William T. Garrigan of the Naval Observatory and Nautical
Almanack about the residuals of Uranus&mdash;that is the residue
in the perturbations of its normal orbit not accounted for by
those due to the known planets. He suggests including
later data than had hitherto been done; asks what elements
other astronomers had taken into account in estimating the
residuals; points out that for different periods they are made
up on different theories in the publications of Greenwich
Observatory, and that some curious facts appear from them.
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
About his own calculation he writes on December 28, 1908:
&ldquo;The results so far are both interesting and promising.&rdquo; He
was hard at work on the calculations for such a planet, based
upon the residuals of Uranus, and assisted by a corps of computers,
with Miss Elizabeth Williams, now Mrs. George
Hall Hamilton of the Observatory at Mandeville, Jamaica,
at their head.</p>
<p>Before trying to explain the process by which he reached
his results it may be well to give his own account of the discovery
of Neptune by a similar method:<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Neptune has proved a planet of surprises. Though its
orbital revolution is performed direct, its rotation apparently
takes place backward, in a plane tilted about 35&deg; to its orbital
course. Its satellite certainly travels in this retrograde manner.
Then its appearance is unexpectedly bright, while its
spectrum shows bands which as yet, for the most part, defy
explanation, though they state positively the vast amount of
its atmosphere and its very peculiar constitution. But first
and not least of its surprises was its discovery,&mdash;a set of surprises,
in fact. For after owing recognition to one of the most
brilliant mathematical triumphs, it turned out not to be the
planet expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Neptune is much nearer the Sun than it ought to be,&rsquo; is
the authoritative way in which a popular historian puts the
intruding planet in its place. For the planet failed to justify
theory by not fulfilling Bode&rsquo;s law, which Leverrier and
Adams, in pointing out the disturber of Uranus, assumed
&lsquo;as they could do no otherwise.&rsquo; Though not strictly correct,
as not only did both geometers do otherwise, but neither did
otherwise enough, the quotation may serve to bring Bode&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
law into court, as it was at the bottom of one of the strangest
and most generally misunderstood chapters in celestial mechanics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very soon after Uranus was recognized as a planet, approximate
ephemerides of its motion resulted in showing
that it had several times previously been recorded as a fixed
star. Bode himself discovered the first of these records, one
by Mayer in 1756, and Bode and others found another made
by Flamsteed in 1690. These observations enabled an elliptic
orbit to be calculated which satisfied them all. Subsequently
others were detected. Lemonnier discovered that he had
himself not discovered it several times, cataloguing it as a
fixed star. Flamsteed was spared a like mortification by being
dead. For both these observers had recorded it two or
more nights running, from which it would seem almost incredible
not to have suspected its character from its change
of place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen of these pre-discovery observations were found
(there are now nineteen known), which with those made
upon it since gave a series running back a hundred and
thirty years, when Alexis Bouvard prepared his tables of the
planet, the best up to that time, published in 1821. In doing
so, however, he stated that he had been unable to find any
orbit which would satisfy both the new and the old observations.
He therefore rejected the old as untrustworthy, forgetting
that they had been satisfied thirty years before, and
based his tables solely on the new, leaving it to posterity, he
said, to decide whether the old observations were faulty or
whether some unknown influence had acted on the planet.
He had hardly made this invidious distinction against the
accuracy of the ancient observers when his own tables began
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
to be out and grew seriously more so, so that within eleven
years they quite failed to represent the planet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The discrepancies between theory and observation attracted
the attention of the astronomic world, and the idea
of another planet began to be in the air. The great Bessel
was the first to state definitely his conviction in a popular
lecture at K&ouml;nigsberg in 1840, and thereupon encouraged his
talented assistant Flemming to begin reductions looking to
its locating. Unfortunately, in the midst of his labors Flemming
died, and shortly after Bessel himself, who had taken
up the matter after Flemming&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhat later Arago, then head of the Paris observatory,
who had also been impressed with the existence of such
a planet, requested one of his assistants, a remarkable young
mathematician named Leverrier, to undertake its investigation.
Leverrier, who had already evidenced his marked
ability in celestial mechanics, proceeded to grapple with the
problem in the most thorough manner. He began by looking
into the perturbations of Uranus by Jupiter and Saturn.
He started with Bouvard&rsquo;s work, with the result of finding it
very much the reverse of good. The farther he went, the
more errors he found, until he was obliged to cast it aside
entirely and recompute these perturbations himself. The
catalogue of Bouvard&rsquo;s errors he gave must have been an
eye-opener generally, and it speaks for the ability and precision
with which Leverrier conducted his investigation that
neither Airy, Bessel, nor Adams had detected these errors,
with the exception of one term noticed by Bessel and subsequently
by Adams.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a> The result of this recalculation of his
was to show the more clearly that the irregularities in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
motion of Uranus could not be explained except by the existence
of another planet exterior to him. He next set himself
to locate this body. Influenced by Bode&rsquo;s law, he began
by assuming it to lie at twice Uranus&rsquo; distance from the Sun,
and, expressing the observed discrepancies in longitude in
equations, comprising the perturbations and possible errors
in the elements of Uranus, proceeded to solve them. He could
get no rational solution. He then gave the distance and the
extreme observations a certain elasticity, and by this means
was able to find a position for the disturber which sufficiently
satisfied the conditions of the problem. Leverrier&rsquo;s first
memoir on the subject was presented to the French Academy
on November 10, 1845, that giving the place of the disturbing
planet on June 1, 1846. There is no evidence that
the slightest search in consequence was made by anybody,
with the possible exception of the Naval Observatory at
Washington. On August 31 he presented his third paper,
giving an orbit, mass, and more precise place for the unknown.
Still no search followed. Taking advantage of the
acknowledging of a memoir, Leverrier, in September, wrote
to Dr. Galle in Berlin asking him to look for the planet.
The letter reached Galle on the 23rd, and that very night he
found a planet showing a disk just as Leverrier had foretold,
and within 55&prime; of its predicted place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The planet had scarcely been found when, on October 1,
a letter from Sir John Herschel appeared in the <i>London
Athenaeum</i> announcing that a young Cambridge graduate,
Mr. J. C. Adams, had been engaged on the same investigation
as Leverrier, and with similar results. This was the first
public announcement of Mr. Adams&rsquo; labors. It then appeared
that he had started as early as 1843, and had communicated
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
his results to Airy in October, 1845, a year before.
Into the sad set of circumstances which prevented the brilliant
young mathematician from reaping the fruit of what
might have been his discovery, we need not go. It reflected
no credit on any one concerned except Adams, who throughout
his life maintained a dignified silence. Suffice it to say
that Adams had found a place for the unknown within a few
degrees of Leverrier&rsquo;s; that he had communicated these results
to Airy; that Airy had not considered them significant
until Leverrier had published an almost identical place; that
then Challis, the head of the Cambridge Observatory, had
set to work to search for the planet but so routinely that he
had actually mapped it several times without finding that
he had done so, when word arrived of its discovery by
Galle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now came an even more interesting chapter in this
whole strange story. Mr. Walker at Washington and Dr.
Petersen of Altona independently came to the conclusion
from a provisional circular orbit for the newcomer that
Lalande had catalogued in the vicinity of its path. They
therefore set to work to find out if any Lalande stars were
missing. Dr. Petersen compared a chart directly with the
heavens to the finding a star absent, which his calculations
showed was about where Neptune should have been at the
time. Walker found that Lalande could only have swept in
the neighborhood of Neptune on the 8th and 10th of May,
1795. By assuming different eccentricities for Neptune&rsquo;s orbit
under two hypotheses for the place of its perihelion, he
found a star catalogued on the latter date which sufficiently
satisfied his computations. He predicted that on searching
the sky this star would be found missing. On the next fine
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
evening Professor Hubbard looked for it, and the star was
gone. It had been Neptune.<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;This discovery enabled elliptic elements to be computed
for it, when the surprising fact appeared that it was not
moving in anything approaching the orbit either Leverrier
or Adams had assigned. Instead of a mean distance of 36
astronomical units or more, the stranger was only at 30.
The result so disconcerted Leverrier that he declared that
&lsquo;the small eccentricity which appeared to result from Mr.
Walker&rsquo;s computations would be incompatible with the
nature of the perturbations of the planet Herschel,&rsquo; as he
called Uranus. In other words, he expressly denied that
Neptune was his planet. For the newcomer proceeded to
follow the path Walker had computed. This was strikingly
confirmed by Mauvais&rsquo; discovering that Lalande had observed
the star on the 8th of May as well as on the 10th, but
because the two places did not agree, he had rejected the
first observation, and marked the second as doubtful, thus
carefully avoiding a discovery that actually knocked at his
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile Peirce had made a remarkable contribution
to the whole subject. In a series of profound papers presented
to the American Academy, he went into the matter more
generally than either of the discoverers, to the startling conclusion
&lsquo;that the planet Neptune is not the planet to which
geometrical analysis had directed the telescope, and that its
discovery by Galle must be regarded as a happy accident.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a>
He first proved this by showing that Leverrier&rsquo;s two fundamental
propositions,&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;1. That the disturber&rsquo;s mean distance must be between
35 and 37.9 astronomical units;</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. That its mean longitude for January 1, 1800, must have
been between 243&deg; and 252&deg;,&mdash;were
incompatible with Neptune. Either alone might be
reconciled with the observations, but not both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In justification of his assertion that the discovery was a
happy accident, he showed that three solutions of the problem
Leverrier had set himself were possible, all equally complete
and decidedly different from each other, the positions
of the supposed planet being 120&deg; apart. Had Leverrier
and Adams fallen upon either of the outer two, Neptune
would not have been discovered.<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;He next showed that at 35.3 astronomical units, an important
change takes place in the character of the perturbations
because of the commensurability of period of a planet
revolving there with that of Uranus. In consequence of
which, a planet inside of this limit might equally account for
the observed perturbations with the one outside of it supposed
by Leverrier. This Neptune actually did. From not considering
wide enough limits, Leverrier had found one solution,
Neptune fulfilled the other.<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a> And Bode&rsquo;s law was responsible
for this. Had Bode&rsquo;s law not been taken originally
as basis for the disturber&rsquo;s distance, those two great geometers,
Leverrier and Adams, might have looked inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This more general solution, as Peirce was careful to state,
does not detract from the honor due either to Leverrier or
to Adams. Their masterly calculations, the difficulty of which
no one who has not had some experience of the subject can
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
appreciate, remain as an imperishable monument to both,
as does also Peirce&rsquo;s to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The facts, that is what was done and written, are of course
correct; but the conclusions drawn from them are highly
controversial to the present day.</p>
<p>The calculations for finding an unknown planet by the
perturbations it causes in the orbit of another are extremely
difficult, the more so when the data are small and uncertain.
For Percival they were very small because Neptune,&mdash;nearest
to the unknown body,&mdash;had been discovered so short a time
that its true orbit, apart from the disturbances therein caused
by other planets, was by no means certain. In fact Percival
tried to analyze its residuals, but they yielded no rational result.
This left only what could be gleaned from Uranus
after deducting the perturbations caused by Neptune, and
that was small indeed. In 1845, when the calculations were
made which revealed that planet, &ldquo;the outstanding irregularities
of Uranus had reached the relatively huge sum of
133&Prime;. To-day its residuals do not exceed 4.5&Prime; at any point of
its path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there are uncertainties depending on errors of observation,
which may be estimated by the method of least
squares of the differences between contemporary observations.
Moreover there is the uncertainty that comes from
not knowing how much of the observed motion is to be
attributed to a normal orbit regulated by the Sun, and how
much to the other planets, including the unknown. Its true
motion under these influences can be ascertained only by observing
it for a long time, and by taking periods sufficiently
far apart to distinguish the continuing effects of the known
bodies from those that flow from an unknown source. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
was the ingenious method devised by Leverrier as a basis
for his calculations, and he thereby got his residuals caused
by the unknown planet in a form that could be handled.</p>
<p>Finally there was the uncertainty whether the residual
perturbations, however accurately determined, were caused
by one or more outer bodies. Of this Percival was, of course,
well aware, and in fact, in his study of the comets associated
with Jupiter he had pointed out that there probably was a
planet far beyond the one for which he was now in search.
But, as no one has ever been able to devise a formula for the
mutual attraction of three bodies, he could calculate only
for a single body that would account as nearly as possible for
the whole of the residuals.</p>
<p>Thus he knew that his work was an approximation; near
enough, he hoped, to lead to the discovery of the unknown.</p>
<p>The various elements in the longitude of a planet&rsquo;s orbit,
that is in the plane of the ecliptic, that are affected by and
affect another, are:</p>
<p>a&mdash;The length of its major, or longest, axis.</p>
<p>n&mdash;Its mean motion, which depends on the distance from
the Sun.</p>
<p>&epsilon;&mdash;The longitude at a given time, that is its place in its
orbit.</p>
<p>e&mdash;The eccentricity of its orbit, that is how far it is from a
circle.</p>
<p>&#8182;&mdash;The place of its perihelion, that is the position of its
nearest approach to the Sun.</p>
<p>(These last two determine the shape of the ellipse, and the
direction of its longer axis with respect to that of the other
planet.)</p>
<p>m&mdash;Its mass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>Now formulas, or series of equations, that express the perturbations
caused by one planet in the orbit of another must
contain all these elements, because all of them affect the
result. But there are too many of them for a direct solution.
Therefore Leverrier assumed a distance of the unknown
planet from the Sun, and with it the mean motion which is
proportional to that distance; worked out from the residuals
of Uranus at various dates a series of equations in terms of
the place of the unknown in its orbit; and then found what
place therein at a given time would give results reducing
the residuals to a minimum&mdash;that is, would come nearest to
accounting for them. In fact, supposing that the unknown
planet would be about the distance from the Sun indicated
by Bode&rsquo;s law, the limits within which he assumed trial
distances were narrow, and, as it proved, wholly beyond the
place where it was found. This method, which in its general
outline Percival followed, consisted therefore of a process of
trial and error for the distance (with the mean motion) and
for the place of X in its orbit (&epsilon;). For the other three elements
(e, &#8182; and m) he used in the various solutions 24 to
37 equations drawn from the residuals of Uranus at different
dates, and expressed in terms of &epsilon;. He did this in order
to have several corroborative calculations, and to discover
which of them accorded most closely with the perturbations
observed.</p>
<p>We have seen that in 1908-09 Percival was inquiring about
the exact residuals of Uranus, and he must have been at work
on them soon afterwards, for on December 1, 1910, he writes
to Mr. Lampland that Miss Williams, his head computer,
and he have been puzzling away over that trans-Neptunian
planet, have constructed the curve of perturbations, but find
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
some strange things, looking as if Leverrier&rsquo;s later theory
of Uranus were not exact. This work had been done by
Leverrier&rsquo;s methods &ldquo;but with extensions in the number and
character of the terms calculated in the perturbation in order
to render it more complete.&rdquo; Though uncertain of his results,
he asks Mr. Lampland, in April 1911, to look for the planet.
But he was by no means himself convinced that his data
were accurate, and he computed all over again with the
residuals given by Gaillot, which he considered more accurate
than Leverrier&rsquo;s in regard to the masses, and therefore the
attractions, of the known planets concerned. Incidentally he
remarks at this point in his Memoir,<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> in speaking of works on
celestial mechanics, that &ldquo;after excellent analytical solutions,
values of the quantities involved are introduced on the basis
apparently of the respect due to age. Nautical Almanacs
abet the practice by never publishing, consciously, contemporary
values of astronomic constants; thus avoiding
committal to doubtful results by the simple expedient of
not printing anything not known to be wrong.&rdquo; His result
for X, as he called the planet he was seeking, computed
by Gaillot&rsquo;s residuals, differed from that found
in using Leverrier&rsquo;s figures by some forty degrees to the
East, and on July 8 he telegraphs Mr. Lampland to look
there.</p>
<p>These telegrams to Mr. Lampland continue at short intervals
for a long time with constant revisions and extensions
in the calculations; and, as he notes, every new move takes
weeks in the doing; but all without finding planet X. Perhaps
it was this disappointment that led him to make the
even more gigantic calculation printed in the Memoir, where
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
he says: &ldquo;In the present case, it seemed advisable to pursue
the subject in a different way, longer and more laborious
than these earlier methods, but also more certain and exact:
that by a true least-square method throughout. When this
was done, a result substantially differing from the preliminary
one was the outcome. It both shifted the minimum
and bettered the solution. In consequence, the whole work
was done <i>de novo</i> in this more rigorous way, with results
which proved its value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then follow many pages of transformations which, as
the guide books say of mountain climbing, no one should
undertake unless he is sure of his feet and has a perfectly
steady head. But anyone can see that, even in the same plane,
the aggregate attractions of one planet on another, pulling
eventually from all possible relative positions in their respective
elliptical orbits with a force inversely as the square
of the ever-changing distance, must form a highly complex
problem. Nor, when for one of them the distance, velocity,
mass, position and shape of orbit are wholly unknown, so
that all these things must be represented by symbols, will
anyone be surprised if the relations of the two bodies are expressed
by lines of these, following one another by regiments
over the pages. In fact the Memoir is printed for those who
are thoroughly familiar with this kind of solitaire.</p>
<p>For the first trial and error Percival assumed the distance
of X from the Sun to be 47.5 planetary units (the distance of
the Earth from the Sun being the unit), as that seemed on
analogy a probable, though by no means a certain, distance.
With this as a basis, and with the actual observations of
Uranus brought to the nearest accuracy by the method of
least-squares of errors, he finds the eccentricity, the place of
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
the perihelion and the mass of X in terms of its position in
its orbit. Then he computes the results for about every ten
degrees all the way round the orbit, and finds two positions,
almost opposite, near 0&deg; and near 180&deg;, which reduce the
residuals to a minimum&mdash;that is which most nearly account
for the perturbations. Each of these thirty tried positions involved
a vast amount of computation, but more still was to
come.</p>
<p>Finally, to be sure that he had covered the ground and left
no loophole for X to escape, he tried, beside the 47.5 he had
already used, a series of other possible distances from the
Sun,&mdash;40.5, 42.5, 45, 51.25 units,&mdash;each of them requiring
every computation to be done over again. But the result
was satisfactory, for it showed that the residuals were most
nearly accounted for by a distance not far from 45 units (or
a little less if the planet was at the opposite side of its orbit),
and that the residuals increased for a distance greater or less
than this. But still he was not satisfied, and for greater security
he took up terms of the second and third order&mdash;very
difficult to deal with&mdash;but found that they made no substantial
difference in the result.</p>
<p>So much for the longitude of X (that is its orbit and position
in the plane of the ecliptic) but that was not all, for its
orbit might not lie in that plane but might be inclined to it,
and like all the other planets he supposed it more or less so&mdash;more
he surmised. Although he made some calculations on
the subject he did not feel that any result obtained would
be reliable, and if the longitude were near enough he thought
the planet could be found. He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To determine the inclination of the orbit of the unknown
from the residuals in latitude of <i>Uranus</i> has proved as inconclusive
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
as Leverrier found the like attempt in the case of
<i>Neptune</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cause of failure lies, it would seem, in the fact that
the elements of X enter into the observational equations for
the latitude. Not only e and &#8182; are thus initially affected
but &epsilon; as well. Hence as these are doubtful from the longitude
results, we can get from the latitude ones only doubtfulness
to the second power.&rdquo; Nevertheless he makes some
calculations on the subject which, however, prove unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Such in outline was his method of calculating the probable
orbit and position in the sky of the trans-Neptunian planet;
an herculean labor carried out with infinite pains, and attaining,
not absolute definiteness, but results from the varying
solutions sufficiently alike to warrant the belief in a close
approximation. In dealing with what he calls the credentials
for the acceptance of his results, he points out that one of
his solutions for X in which he has much confidence, reduces
the squares of the residuals to be accounted for by
ninety per cent., and in the case of some of the others almost
to nothing. Yet he had no illusions about the uncertainty of
the result, for in the conclusions of the Memoir he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that the investigation opens our eyes to the pitfalls of
the past does not on that account render us blind to those of
the present. To begin with, the curves of the solutions show
that a proper change in the errors of observation would quite
alter the minimum point for either the different mean distances
or the mean longitudes. A slight increase of the
actual errors over the most probable ones, such as it by no
means strains human capacity for error to suppose, would
suffice entirely to change the most probable distance of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
disturber and its longitude at the epoch. Indeed the imposing
&lsquo;probable error&rsquo; of a set of observations imposes on no
one familiar with observation, the actual errors committed,
due to systematic causes, always far exceeding it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the next place the solutions themselves tell us of alternatives
between which they leave us in doubt to decide. If
we go by residuals alone, we should choose those solutions
which have their mean longitudes at the epoch in the neighborhood
of 0&deg;, since the residuals are there the smallest. But
on the other hand this would place the unknown now and
for many decades back in a part of the sky which has been
most assiduously scanned, while the solutions with &epsilon; around
180&deg; lead us to one nearly inaccessible to most observatories,
and, therefore, preferable for planetary hiding. Between the
elements of the two, there is not much to choose, all agreeing
pretty well with one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owing to the inexactitude of our data, then, we cannot
regard our results with the complacency of completeness
we should like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bulk of the computations for the trans-Neptunian
planet were finished by the spring of 1914, and in April he
sent to Flagstaff from Boston, where the work had been
done, two of the assistant computers. The final Memoir he
read to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences on
January 13, 1915; and printed in the spring as a publication
of the Observatory. Naturally he was deeply anxious to see
the fruit from such colossal labor. In July, 1913, he had
written to Mr. Lampland: &ldquo;Generally speaking what fields
have you taken? Is there nothing suspicious?&rdquo; and in
May, 1914, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hesitate to startle me with a telegram
&lsquo;FOUND.&rsquo;&rdquo; Again, in August, he writes to Dr. Slipher:
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
&ldquo;I feel sadly of course that nothing has been reported about
X, but I suppose the bad weather and Mrs. Lampland&rsquo;s condition
may somewhat explain it&rdquo;; and to Mr. Lampland in
December: &ldquo;I am giving my work before the Academy on
January 13. It would be thoughtful of you to announce the
actual discovery at the same time.&rdquo; Through the banter one
can see the craving to find the long-sought planet, and the
grief at the baffling of his hopes. That X was not found was
the sharpest disappointment of his life.</p>
<p>If so much labor without tangible result gave little satisfaction,
there was still less glory won by a vast calculation
that did not prove itself correct. Curiously enough, he always
enjoyed more recognition among astronomers in
Europe than in America; for here, as a highly distinguished
member of the craft recently remarked, he did not belong
to the guild. He was fond of calling himself an amateur&mdash;by
which he meant one who worked without remuneration&mdash;and
of noting how many of the great contributors to science
were in that category. The guild here was not readily
hospitable to those who had not been trained in the regular
treadmill; and it had been shocked by his audacity in proclaiming
a discovery of intelligent handiwork on Mars.
So for the most part he remained to the end of his life an
amateur in this country; though what would have been said
had he succeeded in producing, by rigorous calculation, an
unknown planet far beyond the orbit of Neptune, it is interesting
to conjecture, but difficult to know, for the younger
generation of astronomers had not then come upon the stage
nor the older ones outlived their prejudice.</p>
<p>The last eighteen months of his life were spent as usual
partly at Flagstaff, where he was adding to the buildings,
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
partly in Boston, and in lecturing. In May, 1916, he writes
to Sig. Rigano of &ldquo;Scientia&rdquo; that he has not time to write an
article for his Review, and adds: &ldquo;Eventually I hope to publish
a work on each planet&mdash;the whole connected together&mdash;but
the end not yet.&rdquo; Fortunately he did not know how
near it was.</p>
<p>In May he lectured at Toronto; and in the autumn in the
Northwest on Mars and other planets, at Washington State
and Reed Colleges, and the universities of Idaho, Washington,
Oregon and California. These set forth his latest views,
often including much that had been discovered at Flagstaff
and elsewhere since his earlier books were published; for
his mind was far from closed to change of opinion on newly
discovered evidence. It was something of a triumphal procession
at these institutions; but it was too much.</p>
<p>More exhausted than he was himself aware, he returned
to Flagstaff eager about a new investigation he had been
planning on Jupiter&rsquo;s satellites. It will be recalled that
he had found the exact position of the gap in Saturn&rsquo;s rings
accounted for if the inner layers of the planet rotated faster
and therefore were more oblate than the visible gaseous surface.
Now the innermost satellite of Jupiter (the Vth) was
farther off than the simple relation between distance and
period should make it, a difference that might be explained
if in Jupiter, as in Saturn, the molten inner core were more
oblate than the outer gaseous envelope. To ascertain this
the distance of the satellite V. must be determined exactly,
and with Mr. E. C. Slipher he was busy in doing so night
after night through that of November 11th. But he was
overstrained, and the next day, November 12, 1916, not long
after his return to Flagstaff, an attack of apoplexy brought
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
to a sudden close his intensely active life. Before he became
unconscious he said that he always knew it would come
thus, but not so soon.</p>
<p>He lies buried in a mausoleum built by his widow close
to the dome where his work was done.</p>

<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br />PLUTO FOUND<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a></h2>
<p>Percival had long intended that his Observatory should
be permanent, and that his work, especially on the planets,
should be forever carried on there with an adequate foundation.
Save for an income to his wife during her lifetime, he
therefore left his whole fortune in a trust modeled on the
lines of the Lowell Institute in Boston, created eighty years
earlier by his kinsman John Lowell, Jr. The will provides
for a single trustee who appoints his own successor; the first
being his cousin Guy Lowell, the next the present trustee,
Percival&rsquo;s nephew, Roger Lowell Putnam. Dr. V. M. Slipher
and Mr. C. O. Lampland, who have been at the Observatory
from an early time, are the astronomers in charge, carrying
on the founder&rsquo;s principles of constantly enlarging the field
of study, and using for the purpose the best instrumental
equipment to be procured.</p>
<p>Of course the search was continued for the planet X, but
without success, and for a time almost without hope, not
only because its body is too small to show a disk, but also
by reason of the multitude of stars of like size in that crowded
part of the heavens, the Milky Way, where it is extremely
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
difficult to detect one that has moved. It was as if out of
many thousand pins thrown upon the floor one were slightly
moved and someone were asked to find which it was.
Mere visual observation was clearly futile, for no man could
record the positions of all the points of light from one night
to another. The only way to conduct a systematic search was
through an enduring record, that is by taking photographs
of the probable sections of the sky, and comparing two of
the same section taken a few days apart to discover a point
of light that had changed its place&mdash;no simple matter when
more than one hundred thousand stars showed upon a single
plate. This process Percival tried, but although his hopes
were often raised by finding bodies that moved, they proved
to be asteroids hitherto unknown,<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> and the X sought so long
did not appear.<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a></p>
<p>Percival had felt the need of a new photographic telescope
of considerable light power and a wider field, and an attempt
was made to borrow such an instrument, for use while one
was being manufactured, but in vain. Then came the war
when optical glass for large lenses could not be obtained, and
before it was over Percival had died. After his death Guy
Lowell, the trustee, took up the project, but also died too
soon to carry it out. At last in 1929 the lens needed was
obtained, the instrument completed in the workshop of the
Observatory, and the search renewed in March with much
better prospects. Photographs of section after section of the
region where X was expected to be were taken and examined
by a Blink comparator. This is a device whereby two
photographs of slightly different dates could be seen through
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
a microscope at the same time as if superposed. But with
all the improvement in apparatus months of labor revealed
nothing.</p>
<p>After nearly a year of photographing, and comparing
plates, Mr. Clyde W. Tombaugh, a young man brought up
on a farm but with a natural love of astronomy, was working
in this search at Flagstaff, when he suddenly found, on
two plates taken January 23 and 29, 1930, a body that had
moved in a way to indicate, not an asteroid, but something
vastly farther off. It was followed, and appeared night
after night in the path expected for X at about the distance
from the sun Percival had predicted. Before giving out any
information it was watched for seven weeks, until there
could be no doubt from its movements that it was a planet
far beyond Neptune, and was following very closely the
track which his calculations had foretold. Then, on his
birthday, March 13, the news was given to the world.</p>
<p>Recalling Percival&rsquo;s own statement: &ldquo;Owing to the inexactitude
of our data, then, we cannot regard our results
with the complacency of completeness we should like,&rdquo; one
inquires eagerly how nearly the actual elements in the orbit
of the newly found planet agree with those he calculated.
To this an answer was given by Professor Henry Norris
Russell of Princeton, the leading astronomer in this country,
in an article in the <i>Scientific American</i> for December, 1930.
He wrote as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The orbit, now that we know it, is found to be so similar
to that which Lowell predicted from his calculations fifteen
years ago that it is quite incredible that the agreement can be
due to accident. Setting prediction and fact side by side we
have the following table of characteristics:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="l"> </td><td class="c"><i>Predicted</i> </td><td class="r"><i>Actual</i></td></tr>

</table>
<p>&ldquo;Lowell saw in advance that the perturbations of the latitudes
of Uranus and Neptune (from which alone the position
of the orbit plane of the unknown planet could be
calculated) were too small to give a reliable result and contented
himself with the prophecy that the inclination, like
the eccentricity, would be considerable. For the other four
independent elements of the orbit, which are those that
Lowell actually undertook to determine by his calculations,
the agreement is good in all cases, the greatest discrepancy
being in the period, which is notoriously difficult to determine
by computations of this sort. In view of Lowell&rsquo;s explicit
statement that since the perturbations were small the
resulting elements of the orbit could at best be rather rough
approximations, the actual accordance is all that could be
demanded by a severe critic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, the table does not tell the whole story.
Figure 1<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a>
shows the actual and the predicted orbits, the real positions
of the planet at intervals from 1781 to 1989, and the positions
resulting from Lowell&rsquo;s calculations. It appears at once that
the predicted positions of the orbit and of the planet upon it
were nearest right during the 19th century and the early part
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
of the 20th, while at earlier and later dates the error rapidly
increased. Now this (speaking broadly) is just the interval
covered by the observations from which the influence of the
planet&rsquo;s attraction could be determined and, therefore, the
interval in which calculation could find the position of the
planet itself with the least uncertainty.</p>

<p>Except for the eccentricity, and the inclination which he
declared it impossible to calculate, these results have proved
as near as, with the uncertainty of his data, he could have
expected; and in regard to the position of the planet in its
orbit it will be recalled that he found two solutions on opposite
sides, both of which would account almost wholly
for the residuals of Uranus. The one that came nearest to
doing so he had regarded as the least probable because it
placed the planet in a part of the sky that had been much
searched without finding it; but it was there that Pluto appeared&mdash;a
striking proof of his rigorous analytic method.</p>
<p>But the question of its mass has raised serious doubts
whether Pluto can have caused the perturbations of Uranus
from which he predicted its presence, for if it has no significant
mass the whole basis of the calculation falls to the
ground, and there has been found a body travelling, by a
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
marvellous coincidence, in such an orbit that, if large
enough, it would produce the perturbations but does not
do so.<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> Now as there is no visible satellite to gauge its attraction,
and as it will be long before Pluto in its eccentric orbit
approaches Neptune or Uranus closely enough to measure
accurately by that means, the mass cannot yet be determined
with certainty. What is needed are measures of position of
the highest possible accuracy of Neptune and Uranus, long
continued and homogeneous.</p>
<p>The reasons for the doubt about adequate mass are two.<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a>
One that with the largest telescopes it shows no visible disk,
and must therefore be very small in size, and hence in mass
unless its density is much greater, or its albedo far less, than
those of any other known planet. The other substantially
that the orbits of Uranus and Neptune can be, and are more
naturally, explained by assuming appropriate elements
therefor, without the intervention of Pluto&rsquo;s disturbing force.
This is precisely what Percival stated in discussing the correctness
of the residuals&mdash;that it was always possible to
account for the motions of a planet, whose normal orbit
about the sun is not definitely ascertained, by throwing any
observed divergencies either on errors in the supposed orbit,
or upon perturbations by an unknown body.</p>
<p>The conditions here are quite unlike those at the discovery
of Neptune, for there the existence of the perturbations
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
was clear, because fairly large, and the orbit predicted
was wrong because of an error in the distance assumed; and
the question was whether the presence of Neptune in the
direction predicted, though in a different orbit, was an accident,
or inevitable. Here the predicted orbit is substantially
the actual one, adequate to account for the perturbations
of Uranus if such really exist, and the question is
whether they do or not. If not the discovery of Pluto is a
mere unexplained coincidence which has no connection with
the prediction. Whether among recognized uncertainties
it is more rational to suppose a very high density, and very
low albedo, with corresponding perturbations of Uranus
and Neptune, whose orbits are still imperfectly known, or to
conclude that a planet, which would account for these
things if dense enough, revolves in fact in the appropriate
path, a mere ghost of itself&mdash;a phantom but not a force&mdash;one
who is not an astronomer must leave to the professionals.</p>
<p>In the case of both Neptune and Pluto the calculation was
certainly a marvellous mathematical feat, and in accord
with the usual practice whereby the discoverer of a new
celestial body is entitled to propose its name the observers
at Flagstaff selected from many suggestions that of &ldquo;Pluto&rdquo;
with the symbol <img src="images/pic1.jpg" title="ligature, P over L" alt="ligature, P over L" width="15" height="22" />; and henceforth astronomers will be
reminded of Percival Lowell, by the planet he found but
never saw.</p>

<h2 id="c21">APPENDIX I</h2>
<p class="center"><i>Professor Henry Norris Russell&rsquo;s later views on the size of Pluto (written to the Biographer and printed with the writer&rsquo;s consent).</i></p>
<p>Later investigations have revealed a very curious situation.
When once the elements of Pluto&rsquo;s orbit are known, the calculation
of the perturbations which it produces on another planet,
such as Neptune, are greatly simplified. But the problem of
finding Pluto&rsquo;s mass from observations of Neptune is still none
too easy, for the perturbations affect the calculated values of the
elements of Neptune&rsquo;s orbit, and are thus &ldquo;entangled&rdquo; with them
in an intricate fashion.</p>
<p>Nicholson and Mayall, in 1930, attacked the problem, and
found that the perturbations of Neptune by Pluto, throughout
the interval from its discovery to the present, were almost exactly
similar to the effects which would have been produced by certain
small changes in the elements of Neptune&rsquo;s orbit, so that, from
these observations alone, it would have been quite impossible
to detect Pluto&rsquo;s influence. Outside this interval of time, the
effects of the perturbations steadily diverge from those of the
spurious changes in the orbit, but we cannot go into the future
to observe them, and all we have in the past is two rather inaccurate
observations made in 1795 by Lalande.<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a> If the average of
these two discordant observations is taken as it stands, Pluto&rsquo;s
mass comes out 0.9 times that of the Earth, and this determination
is entitled to very little weight.</p>
<p>Uranus is farther from Pluto, and its perturbations are smaller;
but it has been accurately observed over one and a half revolutions,
as against half a revolution for Neptune, and this greatly
favors the separation of the perturbations from changes in the
assumed orbital elements. Professor E. W. Brown&mdash;the most
distinguished living student of the subject&mdash;concludes from a
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
careful investigation that the observations of Uranus show that
Pluto&rsquo;s mass cannot exceed one-half of the Earth&rsquo;s and may be
much less. In his latest work a great part of the complication
is removed by a curiously simple device. Take the sum of the
residuals of Uranus at any two dates separated by one-third of
its period, and subtract from this the residual at the middle date.
Brown proves&mdash;very simply&mdash;that the troublesome effect of uncertainties
in the eccentricity and perihelion of the disturbed
planet will be completely removed from the resulting series of
numbers, leaving the perturbations much easier to detect. The
curve which expresses their effects, though changed in shape, can
easily be calculated. Applying this method to the longitude of
Uranus, he finds, beside the casual errors of observation, certain
deviations; but these change far more rapidly than perturbations
due to Pluto could possibly do, and presumably arise from small
errors in calculating the perturbations produced by Neptune.
When these are accurately re-calculated, a minute effect of
Pluto&rsquo;s attraction may perhaps be revealed, but Brown concludes
that &ldquo;another century of accurate observations appears to be necessary
for a determination which shall have a probable error
less than a quarter of the Earth&rsquo;s mass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conclusion that Pluto&rsquo;s mass is small is confirmed by its
brightness. Its visual magnitude is 14.9&mdash;just equal to that which
Neptune&rsquo;s satellite Triton would have if brought to the same
distance. (Since Pluto&rsquo;s perihelion distance is less than that of
Neptune, this experiment is one which Nature actually performs
at times.) Now Nicholson&rsquo;s observations show that the mass of
Triton is between 0.06 and 0.09 times the Earth&rsquo;s. It is highly
probable that Pluto&rsquo;s mass is about the same&mdash;in which case
the perturbations which it produces, even on Neptune, will be
barely perceptible, so long as observations have their present
degree of accuracy.</p>
<p>The value of seven times the Earth&rsquo;s mass, derived in Percival
Lowell&rsquo;s earlier calculations, must have been influenced by some
error. His mathematical methods were completely sound&mdash;on
Professor Brown&rsquo;s excellent authority&mdash;and the orbit of Planet X
which he computed resembled so closely that of the actual Pluto
that no serious discordance could arise from the difference. But,
in this case also, the result obtained for the mass of the perturbing
planet depended essentially on the few early observations
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
of Uranus as a star, made before its discovery as a planet,
and long before the introduction of modern methods of precise
observation. Errors in these are solely responsible for the inaccuracy
in the results of the analytical solution.</p>
<p>The question arises, if Percival Lowell&rsquo;s results were vitiated
in this way by errors made by others more than a century before
his birth, why is there an actual planet moving in an orbit which
is so uncannily like the one he predicted?</p>
<p>There seems no escape from the conclusion that this is a matter
of chance. That so close a set of chance coincidences should
occur is almost incredible; but the evidence assembled by Brown
permits of no other conclusion. Other equally remarkable coincidences
have occurred in scientific experience. A cipher cable-gram
transmitting to the Lick Observatory the place of a comet
discovered in Europe was garbled in transmission, and when decoded
gave an erroneous position in the heavens. Close to this
position that evening another undiscovered comet was found.
More recently a slight discrepancy between determinations of
the atomic weight of hydrogen by the mass-spectrograph and by
chemical means led to a successful search for a heavy isotype of
hydrogen. Later and more precise work with the mass-spectrograph
showed that the discrepancy had at first been much over-estimated.
Had this error not been made, heavy hydrogen might
not yet have been discovered.</p>
<p>Like this later error, the inaccuracy in the ancient observations,
which led to an over-estimate of the mass and brightness of
Pluto, was a fortunate one for science.</p>
<p>In any event, the initial credit for the discovery of Pluto justly
belongs to Percival Lowell. His analytical methods were sound;
his profound enthusiasm stimulated the search, and, even after
his death, was the inspiration of the campaign which resulted
in its discovery at the Observatory which he had founded.</p>

<br />THE LOWELL OBSERVATORY
<br /><i>by Professor Henry Norris Russell</i></h2>
<p>The Observatory at Flagstaff is Percival Lowell&rsquo;s creation. The
material support which he gave it, both during his lifetime and
by endowment, represents but a small part of his connection
with it. He chose the site, which in its combination of excellent
observing conditions and the amenities of everyday life, is still
unsurpassed. He selected the permanent members of the staff
and provided for the successor to the Directorship after his
death. Last, but not least, he inspired a tradition of intense interest
in the problems of the universe, and independent and original
thought in attacking them, which survives unimpaired.</p>
<p>On a numerical basis&mdash;whether in number of staff, size of
instruments, or annual budget&mdash;the Lowell Observatory takes
a fairly modest rank in comparison with some great American
foundations. But throughout its history it has produced a long
and brilliant series of important discoveries and observations
notable especially for originality of conception and technical skill.
Percival Lowell&rsquo;s own work has been fully described; it remains
to summarize briefly that of the men whom he chose as his colleagues,
presenting it according to its subject, rather than in
chronological order.</p>
<p>The photography of the planets has been pursued for thirty
years, mainly by the assiduous work of E. C. Slipher, and the resulting
collections are unrivalled. Only a small amount of this
store has been published or described in print, but among its
successes may be noted the first photographs of the canals of
Mars, and the demonstration by this impersonal method of the
seasonal changes in the dark areas, and of the occasional appearance
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
of clouds. It is a commonplace that any astronomer who
wants photographs of the planets for any illustrative purpose instinctively
applies to his friends in Flagstaff, and is not likely
to be disappointed.</p>
<p>The discovery of Pluto, and incidentally of many hundreds of
asteroids, has already been described.</p>
<p>An important series of measurements of the radiation from the
planets was made at Flagstaff in 1921 and 1922 by Dr. W. W. Coblentz
of the Bureau of Standards and Dr. C. O. Lampland.
Using the 40-inch reflector, and the vacuum thermocouples which
the former had developed, and employed in measurements of
stellar radiation at the Lick Observatory, and working with and
without a water-cell (which transmits most of the heat carried
by the sunlight reflected from a planet, but stops practically all
of that radiated from its own surface), they found that the true
&ldquo;planetary heat&rdquo; from Jupiter was so small that its surface must
be very cold, probably below -100&deg; Centigrade, while that
from Mars was considerable, indicating a relatively high temperature.
Both conclusions have been fully confirmed by later
work.</p>
<p>Spectroscopic observation has been equally successful. In 1912
Lowell and Slipher (V. M.) successfully attacked the difficult
problem of the rotation of Uranus. One side of a rotating planet
is approaching us, the other receding. If its image is thrown on
a spectroscope, so that its equatorial regions fall upon the slit,
the lines of the spectrum will be shifted toward the violet on one
edge, and the red on the other, and will cross it at a slant instead
of at right angles. This method had long before been applied
to Jupiter and to Saturn and its rings, but Uranus is so faint as
to discourage previous observation. Nevertheless, with the 24-inch
reflector, and a single-prism spectrograph, seven satisfactory
plates were obtained, with an average exposure of 2&frac12; hours,
every one of which showed a definite rotation effect. The mean
result indicated that Uranus rotates in 10&frac34; hours, with motion
retrograde, as in the case of his satellites. This result was confirmed
five years latter by Leon Campbell at Harvard, who observed
regular variations in the planet&rsquo;s brightness with substantially
the same period.</p>
<p>It has been known since the early days of the spectroscope
that the major planets exhibit in their spectra bands produced
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
by absorption by the gases of their atmospheres, and that these
bands are strongest in the outer planets. Photographs showing
this were first made by V. M. Slipher at the Lowell Observatory
in 1902. To get adequate spectrograms of Neptune required exposures
of 14 and 21 hours&mdash;occupying the available parts of
the clear nights of a week. The results well repaid the effort.
The bands which appear faintly in Jupiter are very strong in
Uranus, and enormous in Neptune&rsquo;s spectrum, cutting out great
portions of the red and yellow, and accounting for the well-known
greenish color of the planet. Only one band in the red was
present in Jupiter alone.</p>
<p>For a quarter of a century after this discovery those bands
remained one of the most perplexing riddles of astrophysics.
The conviction gradually grew that they must be due to some
familiar gases, but the first hint of their origin was obtained
by Wildt in 1932, who showed that one band in Jupiter was produced
by ammonia gas, and another probably by methane. These
conclusions were confirmed by Dunham in the following year,
but the general solution of the problem was reserved for Slipher
and Adel, who, in 1934, announced that the whole series of unidentified
bands were due to methane. The reason why they
had not been identified sooner is that it requires an enormous
thickness of gas to produce them. A tube 45 meters long, containing
methane at 40 atmospheres pressure, produces bands
comparable to those in the spectra of Saturn. The far heavier
bands in Neptune indicate an atmosphere equivalent to a layer
25 miles thick at standard atmospheric pressure. The fainter
bands though not yet observed in the laboratory, have been conclusively
identified by the theory of band-spectra. Ammonia
shows only in Jupiter and faintly in Saturn; the gas is doubtless
liquefied or solidified at the very low temperatures of the
outer planets.</p>
<p>The earth&rsquo;s own atmosphere has also been the subject of discovery
at Flagstaff. The light of a clear moonless sky does not
come entirely from the stars and planets; about one-third of it
originates in the upper air, and shows a spectrum of bright lines
and bands. The familiar auroral line is the most conspicuous of
these, but V. M. Slipher, making long exposures with instruments
of remarkably great light-gathering power, has recently detected
a large number of other bands, in the deep red and even the
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
infra-red. Were our eyes strongly sensitive to these wave-lengths,
the midnight skies would appear ruddy.</p>
<p>Just as the first rays of the rising sun strike the upper layers
of the atmosphere many miles above the surface, new emission
bands appear in the spectrum&mdash;to be drowned out soon afterwards
by the twilight reflected from the lower and denser layers;
and the reverse process is observable after sunset.</p>
<p>The origin of these remarkable and wholly unexpected radiations
is not yet determined.</p>
<p>The spectrograph of the Observatory was also employed in
observations of stars, and again led to unexpected discoveries.
In 1908, while observing the spectroscopic binary Beta Scorpii,
V. M. Slipher found that the K line of calcium was sharp on
his plates, while all the others were broad and diffuse. Moreover,
while the broad lines shifted in position as the bright star moved
in its orbit, the narrow line remained stationery. Hartmann, in
1904, had observed a similar line in the spectra of Delta Orionis,
and suggested that it was absorbed in a cloud of gas somewhere
between the sun and the star. Slipher, extending his observations
to other parts of the heavens, found that such stationery
calcium lines were very generally present (in spectra of such
types that they were not masked by heavier lines arising in the
stars themselves), and made the bold suggestion that the absorbing
medium was a &ldquo;general veil&rdquo; of gas occupying large
volumes of interstellar space.</p>
<p>This hypothesis, which appeared hardly credible at that time,
has been abundantly confirmed&mdash;both by the discovery of similar
stationery lines of sodium, and by the theoretical researches of
Eddington,&mdash;and no one now doubts that interstellar space is
thinly populated by isolated metallic atoms presumably ejected
from some star in the remote past, but now wandering in the
outer darkness, with practically no chance of returning to the
stars.</p>
<p>To secure satisfactory spectroscopic observations of nebulae is
often very difficult. Though some of these objects are of considerable
brightness, they appear as extended luminous surfaces in
the heavens, and in the focal plane of the telescope. The slit of
a spectroscope, which must necessarily be narrow to permit good
resolution of the lines, admits but a beggarly fraction of the
nebula&rsquo;s light. To increase the size of the telescope helps very
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
little, for, though more light is collected in the nebular image,
this image is proportionately increased in area, and no more
light enters the slit than before.</p>
<p>For the gaseous nebulae, whose spectra consist of separate
bright lines, there is no serious difficulty; but the majority of
nebulae have continuous spectra, and when the small amount of
light that traverses the slit is spread out into a continuous band,
it becomes so faint that prohibitively long exposures would be
required to photograph it. It was at the Lowell Observatory
that Dr. V. M. Slipher first devised a way of meeting this difficulty.</p>
<p>By employing in the camera of the spectrograph (which forms
the image of the spectrum on the plate) a lens of short focus,
this image became both shorter and narrower, thereby increasing
the intensity of the light falling on a given point of the plate in
a duplicate ratio. Moreover, since with this device the image of
the slit upon the plate is much narrower than the slit itself, it
became possible to open the slit more widely and admit much
more of the light of the nebula, without spoiling the definition
of the spectral lines.</p>
<p>This simple but ingenious artifice opened up a wholly new
field of observation, and led to discoveries of great importance.</p>
<p>Within the cluster of the Pleiades, and surrounding it, are
faint streaky wisps of nebulosity, which have long been known.
One might have guessed that the spectrum, like that of some
other filamentous nebulae, would be gaseous. But when Slipher
photographed it in December 1912 (with an exposure of 21
hours, on three successive nights) he found a definite continuous
spectrum, crossed by strong dark lines of hydrogen and
fainter lines of helium&mdash;quite unlike the spectrum of any previously
observed nebula, but &ldquo;a true copy of that of the brighter
stars in the Pleiades.&rdquo; Careful auxiliary studies showed that the
light which produced this spectrum came actually from the
nebula. This suggested at once that this nebula is not self-luminous,
but shines by the reflected light of the stars close to it.
This conclusion has been fully verified by later observations,
at Flagstaff and elsewhere. It is only under favorable conditions
that one of these vast clouds (probably of thinly scattered dust)
lies near enough to any star to be visibly illuminated. The rest
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
reveal themselves as dark markings against the background of
the Milky Way.</p>
<p>Similar observations of the Great Nebula of Orion showed
that the conspicuous &ldquo;nebular&rdquo; lines found in its brighter portions
faded out in its outer portions, leaving the hydrogen lines
bright, while, at the extreme edge, only a faint continuous spectrum
appeared. This again has been fully explained by Bowen&rsquo;s
discovery of the mechanism of excitation of nebular radiation by
the ultra-violet light from exceedingly hot stars, and affords a
further confirmation of it.</p>
<p>But the most important contribution of the new technique
was in the observation of the spiral nebulae. Their spectra are
continuous and so faint that previous instruments brought out
only tantalizing suggestions of dark lines. With the new spectrograph,
beautiful spectra were obtained, showing numerous dark
lines, of just the character that might have been expected from
vast clouds of stars of all spectral types. This provided the first
definite indication of one of the greatest of modern astronomical
discoveries&mdash;that the white nebulae are external galaxies, of
enormous dimensions, and at distances beyond the dreams of an
earlier generation.</p>
<p>By employing higher dispersion, spectra were secured which
permitted the measurement of radial velocity. The first plates,
of the Andromeda Nebula, revealed the almost unprecedented
speed of 300 kilometers per second toward the Sun. Later
measures of many other nebulae showed that this motion was,
for a nebula, unusually slow, but remarkable in its direction,
for practically all the others were receding.</p>
<p>Similar measures upon globular star-clusters showed systematic
differences in various parts of the heavens, which indicated
that, compared with the vast system of these clusters, the
Sun is moving at the rate of nearly 300 kilometers per second&mdash;a
motion which is now attributed to its revolution, in a vast orbit,
about the center of the Galaxy, as a part of the general rotation
of the latter.</p>
<p>The velocities of the nebulae reveal substantially the same solar
motion, but, over and above this, an enormous velocity of recession,
increasing with the faintness and probable distance of the
nebulae.</p>
<p>This, again, was a discovery of primary importance. It has
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
been confirmed at other observatories and observations with the
largest existing telescope have revealed still greater velocities of
recession in nebulae too faint to observe at Flagstaff. How this
has led to the belief that the material universe is steadily expanding
and that its ascertainable past history covers only some
two thousand millions of years, can only be mentioned here.</p>
<p>This is a most remarkable record for thirty years&rsquo; work of a
single observatory with a regular staff never exceeding four
astronomers. But its distinction lies less in the amount of the
work than in its originality and its fertile character in provoking
extensive and successful researches at other observatories as well.</p>
<p>All this is quite in the spirit of its Founder, and, to his colleagues
in the science, makes the Observatory itself seem his true
monument. His body lies at rest upon the hill, but, in an unquenched
spirit of eager investigation, his soul goes marching on.</p>

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_19" href="#fr_19">[19]</a>In a letter to Dr. V. M. Slipher on Oct. 4, 1902 he writes:</div>
<div class="fncont">&ldquo;There has come into my head a new way for detecting the spectral lines
due to a planet&rsquo;s own atmospheric absorption, and I beg you will apply it to
Mars so soon as the Moon shall be in position to make a comparison spectrum.</div>
<div class="fncont">&ldquo;It is this. At quadrature of an exterior planet we are travelling toward that
planet at the rate of 18.5 miles a second and we are carrying of course our
own atmosphere with us. Our motion shortens all the wave-lengths sent us
from the planet, including those which have suffered absorption in <i>its</i> atmosphere.
When the waves reach <i>our</i> atmosphere those with a suitable wavelength
are absorbed by it and these wave-lengths are unaffected by our motion
since it is at rest as regards us. Even were the two atmospheres alike the absorbed
wave-lengths reaching us would thus be different since the one set, the
planet&rsquo;s, have been shifted by our motion toward it while the other set, our own,
are such as they would be at rest. We thus have a criterion for differentiating
the two. And the difference should be perceptible in your photographs. For the
shift of Jupiter&rsquo;s lines due to rotation is such as 8. &times; 2. = 16 miles a second
produces, which is less than 18.5 and about what you will get now.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_20" href="#fr_20">[20]</a>So far as the shooting stars are concerned this opinion was based upon
their velocities, which have since been found in many cases to be greater than
was then supposed.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_21" href="#fr_21">[21]</a>Opic has recently shown that the sun&rsquo;s effective domain is even larger.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_22" href="#fr_22">[22]</a>Later observations seem to show that Mercury&rsquo;s periods of rotation and

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_24" href="#fr_24">[24]</a>Recent results indicate that these are much smaller, and sometimes move
faster, than was formerly believed.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_25" href="#fr_25">[25]</a>This theory, though generally held till 1930, has apparently been disproved
by Jeffries.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_26" href="#fr_26">[26]</a>The periods of revolution and rotation have since appeared not to be
exactly the same.

at a very low temperature.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_28" href="#fr_28">[28]</a>As these thickenings, which he called tores, were not perceived the next time
the rings were seen edgewise&mdash;although probably there&mdash;it is needless to dwell
more upon them.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_29" href="#fr_29">[29]</a>By continued, and quite recent, study at Flagstaff the content of this gas
has been found to be for Jupiter and Saturn one half, for Uranus five times
and for Neptune twenty-five times the amount of the atmosphere of the Earth.</div>

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_30" href="#fr_30">[30]</a>Since he wrote, the discovery of radio-active substances has given rise to a

is that the level from which this matter came is revolving faster than the atmospheric

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
